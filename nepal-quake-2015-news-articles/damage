1003.txt:A helicopter is scheduled to transport Asraf’s body from the village to the Israeli field hospital in Kathmandu early Monday morning.Asraf was the sole Israeli missing in Nepal and the country’s only fatality in the earthquake that has claimed more than 7,000 lives.There were some 650 Israelis in Nepal at the time of the earthquake. Over the week, hundreds flew home while the Foreign Ministry slowly tracked down 249 unaccounted for citizens, many of whom were rescued by helicopter from remote areas such as the Langtang.But as the days passed with no word from his son, Patrick Asraf, along with former members of Or’s elite Egoz reconnaissance unit – including its commander – flew to Nepal last week to take part in the search.Members of the unit were the ones to make the grim discovery on Sunday that Asraf, who had hiked quickly ahead of his friends, had been killed in an avalanche.“[The commander] and Or’s friends combed the area for three days in an exhaustive search, under unbearable conditions,” Asraf’s father told reporters.“Once his friends identified him, they took him with them, as they hiked in the direction of the nearest village that was over an hour’s walk away. They risked their lives to walk with him, in the dark, so they could return him home,” he said.When Patrick Asraf first arrived in Nepal, he had sworn he would not leave without his son. He held onto stories of survivors found after days without contact, but his determination wavered after he saw the extent of the damage.The earthquake, he said, created “boulders, creating terrible avalanches that tossed aside trees as if they were toothpicks. It swept the trees, the boulders and of course people in the direction of the river.“As the days passed, the scenarios were less and less optimistic,” he said. “I wasn’t sure I would be able to stand by my promise to bring Or home. I was afraid that in the end I would have to leave him in the mountains.”He was relieved, he said, that this was not the case. “Out of all the scenarios that raced through my head, this was not the worst.”Initially, a desperate Patrick had issued harsh statements to the media about his frustration with the government over the slow pace of the search.But on Sunday, Patrick thanked everyone involved in three days of intense searches for his son. This included the Home Front Command and the Nepalese Army, as well as private Israeli rescue teams, including ZAKA and United Hatzalah.“There is nothing I asked for that I did not get,” Patrick said.Or Asraf had gone to Nepal after he was demobilized from the army, after taking part in last summer’s Operation Protective Edge. He was wounded in Gaza in an explosion that killed his friend, St.-Sgt. Tal Ifrach, 21.On Remembrance Day he sent a recorded message to Ifrach’s mother, Aviva, from Nepal to tell her that he was thinking of her.“I know that today is not easy. I love you and miss you. Be strong,” he said.President Reuven Rivlin said the news of Asraf’s death was heartbreaking.“The mobilization of search and rescue forces, and the loyal support of his army comrades in the search, instilled within us great hope. It was the prayer of an entire nation that he would be found alive and well. My sympathies go out to his family after this difficult and tragic loss,” Rivlin said.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Patrick in Nepal and told him, “We did our utmost to find Or, but we hoped for a different outcome. This is the State of Israel’s obligation to Or, a heroic soldier who fought for the security of Israel’s citizens. I share in your family’s deep sorrow.”

1027.txt:NEW DELHI: India jumped to Nepal's rescue in record time, after a massive earthquake on Saturday flattened large parts of Kathmandu valley and Pokhara leaving a trail of death and destruction.Within the first few minutes, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached out to Nepalese President Ram Baran Yadav and PM Sushil Koirala. In an early tweet, PM said, "Spoke to PM Sushil Koirala, who is in transit in Bangkok on his way to Kathmandu. Assured all support & assistance during this tough time."Modi led from the front, monitoring and directing India's response to the Himalayan tragedy directly. "As directed by the PM, we have mobilised all resources to support Nepal," said defence minister Manohar Parrikar, adding that all Army units spread across north India have also been asked to help in the rescue and relief operations in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and other affected regions."We are offering full assistance to Nepal," foreign secretary S Jaishankar told journalists. The Indian government, he said, responded to a broad-based request from the Nepal government - for rescue teams, medical teams and damage assessment teams.By Sunday, the government would bring back 250 Indians stuck in the disaster zone, 52 of whom were brought back on Saturday night. India has dispatched 260 relief personnel and 20 tonnes of relief material to Nepal.The IAF responded swiftly, dispatching four aircraft and two helicopters with NDRF personnel, medical teams, relief supplies and sniffer dogs to the landlocked country by Saturday evening. Jaishankar said by Sunday India would have five helicopters in Kathmandu and five in Pokhara for local rescue and airlift operations as well as food distribution.A major-general, J S Sandhu, from the Army headquarters was also deputed to Nepal on Saturday evening to oversee and coordinate the operations in the Himalayan country. "My primary task is to be the point-person between the Indian armed forces and the Nepalese Army, check out what is required and how the resources and relief material being sent from India are deployed there," he told TOI, just before boarding a C-17 headed for Kathmandu.The first C-130J Super Hercules, with 40 NDRF personnel and 3.5 tonnes, took off from the Hindon airbase for Kathmandu at 3.55 pm for the 90-minute flight to Kathmandu. It was followed by two C-17 Globemaster and one IL-76 aircraft, with over 250 NDRF personnel, 43 tonnes of relief material, five sniffer dogs and a RAMT (rapid aeromedical team) with medical equipment and 24 doctors and paramedics. Two Mi-17s also left for Nepal from Gorakhpur, but had to return due to bad weather.Jaishankar said India hopes to do a damage assessment of the area by Sunday, following which New Delhi would dispatch more targeted rescue and rehabilitation assistance. "We also hope tomorrow morning to have specialized engineering teams with rescue equipment going in from Bhatinda," he added.The Army, too, was keeping two field hospitals and two engineer task-forces on the stand-by for rushing to Nepal, with Army chief General Dalbir Singh Suhag in regular touch with his Nepalese counterpart to extend any help to the Himalayan country.Jaishankar said, "As soon as the earthquake happened, our embassy got in touch with the Government of Nepal and we also, the Ministry of External affairs, were in touch with the embassy of Nepal."The government asked citizens to respond with details of family or friends who may be in Nepal. "We have set up a helpline in the ministry; the numbers have been put out. We would also request that if there are people who know that their relatives are in Nepal to send us their details. So, there is a e-mail address which is controlroom@mea.gov.in. if anybody who would like to keep us informed about their relatives and give us their contact numbers that would be very helpful for us," Jaishankar said.The government also announced that all calls made to Nepal through the BSNL network would be charged on local rates for the next three days.

1053.txt:As many as 2,500 people were killed in the 7.8 magnitude earthquake which shook Nepal Saturday morning. The disaster occurred about 82 kilometers (51 miles) northwest of the capital Kathmandu, causing massive damage in the region. The area also experienced a powerful wave of aftershocks following the quake.
1057.txt:A growing sense of despair spread through Kathmandu on Sunday as the devastated Nepali capital was convulsed by aftershocks that sent residents screaming into the streets, where they were pelted by heavy rain.A day after an earthquake killed more than 2,400 people and injured about 5,900, residents grew frantic and the government, entirely overwhelmed by the enormousness of the challenge facing the country, struggled to provide relief, or much hope.Streets in parts of this city of about 1.2 million were impassable not so much from quake damage but because tens of thousands of people took up residence there. It was a strategy endorsed by the government.Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, who was attending a conference in Indonesia when the quake struck, had rushed back to Kathmandu and was to speak in a televised address Sunday. But the speech was delayed, as some relief efforts have been, by strong tremors that continue to rock the country.The already difficult situation in much of the capital, where safe shelters are scarce, was made worse Sunday when rains began to pour down on huddled masses.It is increasingly evident that Nepali authorities were ill-equipped to rescue those trapped and would have trouble maintaining adequate supplies of water, electricity and food."In my neighborhood, the police are conspicuous by their absence," said Sridhar Khatri of the South Asia Center for Policy Studies in Kathmandu. "There is not even a show of force to deter vandalism, which some reports say is on the rise."On Sunday, the government began setting up 16 relief stations across Kathmandu and the rest of the country while rescue operations continued. The relief stations are expected to ease distribution of water, food and medicine, said Laxmi Prasad Dhakal, a spokesman at the Ministry of Home Affairs.Electricity has been intermittent at best in Kathmandu, and absent entirely in other parts of Nepal, but that is not wholly unusual in a country where nighttime blackouts are routine.Many hotels, commercial buildings and wealthy homes in the capital have their own generators. But nearly all of the country's gas and diesel supplies are brought in from India, and with traffic reduced to a crawl along major highways, those supplies could dwindle quickly. Some gas stations in Kathmandu have already run dry; others are rationing their remaining supplies.Thousands of Kathmandu's residents squatted on streets throughout the city either because their homes were destroyed or because continued aftershocks, including one of magnitude 6.7, left them too afraid to go inside. Other residents camped out in schools, school playgrounds and government offices.The government announced that schools would remain closed for at least five days, and it pleaded with government workers to help in local rescue efforts in place of their usual jobs.Stephen Groves, who lives in Kathmandu, said he was inspecting a building for cracks shortly after noon on Sunday when the biggest of many aftershocks hit, leading to terrified screams from those nearby."The whole time I was thinking if the building next to me was going to come down on top of me," Groves said in an email. "People here are in a panic, and every aftershock contributes to that. They are not going indoors, they are staying in the roads and in open areas. Many are searching for family members."Groves said he went to a hospital in the capital Saturday, where hordes of people were lying on the ground outside the building, many with intravenous drips hooked up to their arms.The city was awash with rumors that the worst aftershocks were yet to come and with fears of greater destruction in the countryside, large swaths of which remained unreachable by phone.Subhash Ghimire, the editor-in-chief of the Nepalese newspaper Republica, said he managed to reach his father in his village, home to about 3,000 people, near the epicenter in the Gorkha district."He said not a single house is left in our village, including our own house," Ghimire said.On Mount Everest, helicopter rescue operations began Sunday morning to bring wounded climbers down off the mountain, where at least 18 climbers were killed and another 41 injured, making the earthquake the deadliest event in the mountain's history. Three Americans were among those killed, according to the U.S. State Department. Aftershocks and small avalanches throughout the day Sunday continued to plague the nearly 800 people staying at the mountain base camp and at higher elevation camps.After posting on Twitter that he was "fairly safe but stuck" at the base camp, a climber, Jim Davidson, then provided a more alarming update from Camp 1, which is above the base camp. "Just had our biggest aftershock yet here at C1 on Everest. Smaller than original quake but glacier shook & avalanches," he said.Nick Talbot, 39, was attempting to be the first person with cystic fibrosis to climb Mount Everest when a 100- to 200-yard wall of ice and snow came barreling toward him."I ran away," he said. "I thought, 'There is no chance I can get away.' I just had my socks on. It knocked me into the rocks. I got up and it knocked me over again." he said. He was evacuated by helicopter Sunday afternoon. All of his belongings were buried by the avalanche."I'm sure there will have been many fatalities just because the scale of it," he said.Tulasi Prasad Gautam, director general of Nepal's Tourism Department, said he feared that continued aftershocks had trapped more climbers. In addition to the dead and injured, nearly 25 climbers who had been en route Saturday to Camp 2 from Camp 1 are missing."Actually, the tents are still there for some 20 to 25 climbers who were heading towards Camp 2 in the course of climbing practice, but they are not in contact," Gautam said.In a blog post Sunday, Eric Simonson of International Mountain Guides said the news from the Everest base camp "was quite bleak," and that the company's encampment "has been turned into a triage center, and our big dining tents are now being used as hospital tents.""The tons and tons of falling ice going this vertical distance created a huge aerosol avalanche and accompanying air blast," he wrote. "It is worth noting that over many expeditions we have never seen an avalanche from this area that was even remotely of this scale."Susan Parker-Burns, a spokeswoman from the U.S. Embassy in Nepal, said in an email Sunday that a rescue-and-relief team from the U.S. Agency for International Development was dispatched by military transport to Nepal, and they would arrive Monday.Also Sunday, the Israeli military said that it was preparing to send two Boeing 747s carrying 260 aid workers and more than 90 tons of cargo to Kathmandu.About 600 Israelis are believed to be in Nepal, a popular destination for young backpackers after their compulsory military service. Magen David Adom, Israel's national emergency medical response organization, had already sent an advance team of 10 paramedics and two doctors to Nepal.Nepal will most likely require significant help. The country's existing political discord is likely to hamper rescue and rebuilding efforts. The government has been barely functional for more than a decade, with politicians of just about every stripe fighting over the scraps of the increasingly desperate economy. A 10-year civil war between Maoist parties and the government ended in 2006, but the resulting Constituent Assembly spent four years trying to write a constitution without success. Paralysis ensued until elections in November 2013 led to the unexpected rout of the previously dominant Maoists.Nepal's people had already become exhausted with the political paralysis, but those feelings could turn explosive if relief and rescue efforts fail in the coming weeks, analysts said. The fear of such an outcome could spur an intense international relief effort, as an odd collection of countries - including China, India and the United States - were already cooperating on pushing Nepal's politicians toward compromise.

1146.txt:KATHMANDU - A massive earthquake killed more than 1,341 people Saturday as it tore through large parts of Nepal, toppling office blocks and towers in Kathmandu and triggering a deadly avalanche at Everest base camp.Officials said at least 1,341 people are known to have died in Nepal, making it the quake-prone Himalayan nation’s worst disaster in more than 80 years.But the final toll from the 7.8 magnitude quake could be much higher, and dozens more people were reported killed in neighbouring India and China.“The death toll has reached 1,341” Nepal police spokesman Kamal Singh Bam told reporters, adding that rescue efforts were still underway.Emergency workers fanned out across the Himalayan nation to rescue those trapped under collapsed homes, buildings and other debris.Officials said 10 people were killed when an avalanche buried parts of Mount Everest’s base camp in Nepal where hundreds of mountaineers have gathered at the start of the annual climbing season.Kathmandu was severely damaged, and the historic nine-storey Dharahara tower, a major tourist attraction, was among buildings brought down.At least a dozen bodies were taken away from the ruins of the 19th-century tower, according to an AFP photographer who saw similar scenes of multiple casualties throughout the city.“It was difficult to breath, but I slowly moved the debris. Someone then pulled me out. I don’t know where my friends are,” Dharmu Subedi, 36, who was standing outside the tower when it collapsed, said from a hospital bed.At least 42 people were known to have died in India, including 30 in the eastern state of Bihar, while buildings in the capital New Delhi had to be evacuated. Tremors were also felt as far as in Pakistan.The United States Geological Survey said the shallow quake struck 77 kilometres northwest of Kathmandu at 0611 GMT, with walls crumbling and families racing outside their homes.The quake tore through the middle of highways in the capital and also caused damage to the country’s only international airport which was briefly closed.Kari Cuelenaere, an official at the Dutch embassy, said the impact had swept the water out of a swimming pool at a Kathmandu hotel where Dutch national day was being celebrated.“It was horrible, all of a sudden all the water came up out of the pool and drenched everyone, the children started screaming,” Cuelenaere told AFP. “Some parts of the city fell down, there was dust rising... There were many (rescue) helicopters.”Aftershock tremors could be felt more than two hours after the initial quake.USGS initially measured the quake at 7.5 magnitude and later adjusted it to 7.8, with a depth of 15 kilometres.A spokesman for Nepal’s home ministry said the government had released around $500 million as emergency funds for rescue operations.China’s official Xinhua news agency said that 13 people, including an 83-year-old woman, were killed in the Tibet region.The area has a history of earthquakes, with a 6.8 magnitude quake that hit eastern Nepal in August 1988 killing 721 people. A magnitude 8.1 quake killed 10,700 people in Nepal and eastern India in 1934.More details on Page 11
1148.txt:Nepalese media have reported that the latest aftershock may have also claimed hundreds of lives near its epicenter, as it triggered landslides in the surrounding area. It is yet unclear, however, how many lives have been lost. The "second quake" - as many people are now calling the aftershock - also caused severe structural damage, given that many of the buildings that had only cracked during the first quake have now collapsed.
1148.txt:At the moment, the aftershocks and the ensuing damage and chaos are the major obstacles for aid relief teams. Many roads have now been cleared for transportation, allowing rescue teams not only to reach the injured, but also to travel to other affected parts of the country.

1148.txt:However, the extent of the damage is very large, especially in the villages around Kathmandu, so much more aid will be needed in the coming days. The key question is when it will get there.

The 60m tower was built in 1832 for the Queen of Nepal. Yesterday, all that remained of the lighthouse-like building was a jagged stump just 10m high. Sujata Thapa (22) said he was passing Dharahara when the quake struck. "I stood still. In a few seconds, I saw Dharahara falling down. People were screaming."

1244.txt:Residents of Nepal's capital are seeking refuge outside Sunday night, fearful of further aftershocks after a massive earthquake rocked much of the country a day earlier, killing at least 2,500 people. Disaster response teams from the United States and other nations are deploying to help search, rescue, and recovery efforts. Thousands of people are injured, and an unknown number are unaccounted for. Saturday's 7.8-magnitude quake struck 80 kilometers northwest of Kathmandu, destroying large parts of the city's historic center. A 6.7 aftershock was among at least 18 smaller quakes that shook the Kathmandu area since. No effects of the latest quake have yet been announced. Citing Nepali government sources, the United Nations said 35 of the country's 75 districts are affected. An estimated 30 million people live in Nepal. On a website established by the International Committee of the Red Cross, hundreds of Nepalis and foreigners are reported missing by their loved ones. Far fewer have checked in on the site to report they are alive. The earthquake rocked the mountainous region minutes before noon local time on Saturday, flattening historic structures of wood and brick in the ancient capital city. At least 180 people were reported dead when the city's iconic Dharahara Tower -- a UNESCO world heritage site -- collapsed. To the east, avalanches shook Mt. Everest -- the highest point on earth -- killing at least 18 climbers, injuring many others and burying entire base camps. By early Sunday, sources reported to VOA deaths and extensive property damage in the Tibet Autonomous Region, hundreds of kilometers north of Kathmandu. At least 34 people were killed in India, as other partial casualty reports from far-flung regions came from Bangladesh, Bhutan and elsewhere in the vast and remote Nepal-Chinese border regions.

1288.txt:NEW DELHI: In one of its quickest and most extensive responses to an international emergency, India flew in rescue teams, medical supplies and relief material to Nepal where the death toll in the weekend's earthquake crossed 2,500 by Sunday night.The 7.9-magnitude quake that hit the Himalayan nation also left at least 62 people dead in India, mostly close to the border with Nepal. Bihar reported 46 deaths and Uttar Pradesh , 13. Reports from Kathmandu indicated a trail of destruction and harrowing time for its residents.Bodies were still being pulled out from under the rubble of collapsed buildings, often with bare hands, and the city's hospitals were swamped with injured.Outside Kathmandu Medical College, a makeshift operation theatre was set up in a tent to carry out emergency surgeries and doctors said there was a severe shortage of medical supplies.Rescue and relief work had to be stopped for a while on Sunday following a strong aftershock, which itself measured 6.7 and sent horrified people out into the streets. India was the first to send in aid, with supplies starting within hours of Saturday's killer quake.On Sunday, as many as 19 aircraft with relief material and rescue teams were sent. In its rescue efforts in Nepal, New Delhi has also upstaged China, which on Sunday sent in a rescue team with sniffer dogs and equipment.Officials said India's response was unusually quick."The instructions were clear that all possible assets have to be deployed with no time lapse," an official, who is part of the response team, told ET."Unlike in the past when the military would be ready with a plan but would await political clearance that could take days at a time, the instructions from top were quick and precise."Operating at the very epicentre of the earthquake, Indian Air Force choppers rescued more than 200 people in 37 sorties from the worst-affected districts. India has also set up a field hospital in Kathmandu and sent in its engineers to work on restoring road connectivity."Besides rescuing people, the immediate task is to move equipment by air to open the roads to the interior (areas) where damage assessment has not been made. We are also repairing helipads so that a large-scale rescue effort can start that involves civilian operators," a defence ministry official said.An Indian Army expedition to Mt Everest which had a miraculous escape as it was practising when an avalanche hit its camp on Saturday has also been roped in for relief efforts. The team has dug out at least 19 bodies from the base camp besides rescuing 61 injured climbers. An Indian doctor, who is part of the team, is treating the injured.PM Narendra Modi , who chaired a meeting with top ministers and the national security adviser, has ordered that the road route to Nepal should be opened and utilised to evacuate people and send in supplies. Modi has been monitoring the relief efforts personally and told the defence ministry, which is carrying out a bulk of the relief work, to spare no expense in the relief efforts, sources said.India, which has so far deployed 19 aircraft including six choppers in Nepal, has kept more on standby for deployment if necessary. India will be sending more than 50 tonnes of water daily as long as it is required by Nepal.

1449.txt:A small IAF plane was the first carrier to arrive back in Israel from Nepal. It landed at a military base early Monday. On board were a number of wounded Israelis and premature babies of Israeli parents who were born to surrogate Nepalese mothers.A Magen David Adom plane with five more babies born to surrogate mothers and their Israeli families landed at Sde Dov Airport at noon on Monday. Over a dozen such babies still need to be airlifted home.Three IAF Hercules planes left for Nepal on Monday as did two El Al jumbo jets with missions jointly organized by the IDF and the Foreign Ministry.The large carriers with 260 personnel on board also transported 95 tons of equipment including a field hospital with a ward for premature babies. Rescuers brought with them cutting equipment, electronic devices to help find victims trapped under the rubble, generators, lighting equipment, and more.When the large planes leave Nepal they hope to carry some of the100 Israelis in the Chabad House in Kathmandu and another 150 who have sought refuge in the Israeli Embassy.Since Saturday the Foreign Ministry has helped locate 150 missing Israelis, but there are still 100 who are unaccounted for.Israel is also working with the Nepalese government to send helicopters to more remote areas, such as the Frozen Lakes, to find stranded Israelis who were in the midst of treks when the quake struck.On Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with the delegation headed by Col. Yoram Laredo, who told Netanyahu that an advance team had already landed and was preparing the infrastructure for the arrival of their larger mission.Netanyahu said, “You are being sent on an important mission. This is the true face of Israel – a country that offers aid over any distance at such moments. Good luck. We are counting on you.”Several hours later, Dr. Rafi Strugo, director of MDA’s medical division told The Jerusalem Post that he and another physician and 10 paramedics had just arrived at the Kathmandu airport on a plane from Israel.“We landed at night, so we couldn’t see very much from the air, but there were some lights below,” he said. “From the ground, the airport looks okay. We will now divide up between the Israel Embassy and Chabad house and expect to be here for at least a week.”The MDA team will provide triage-style emergency first aid to the injured, wherever they are located; create a first-aid station where MDA can provide treatment for the first 48 hours by providing painkillers, antibiotics, bandages and preparing severely injured victims for transport to area hospitals; and help the “second wave” of victims – those who arrive three or four days later – by opening and operating a field hospital.MDA officials said its medical delegation flew directly to Kathmandu to set up a base to help the Israelis and the locals.The situation is complicated by avalanches and aftershocks.The delegation includes doctors, paramedics and logistical experts who brought with them drugs and medical equipment including incubators and baby food.The MDA team includes a wide range of experts with disaster-response experience in Japan, Haiti and the Philippines.A primary focus will be setting up local aid stations in outlying regions as well as extricating and evacuating victims to the stations.It is also working to help return some two dozen Israeli couples, most of them homosexuals, who went to Nepal to have a baby via a woman surrogate.The pregnant women and the newborns, including premature babies, have to be helped and brought back from areas devastated by the quake.MDA has opened a fund for donations to help the locals and contributions can be sent to a special bank account – Survivors of the Nepal Earthquake at Bank Discount (#11), Yad Eliahu Branch (151), account number 22016.Meanwhile, the World Health Organization has sent a first shipment of medications and medical supplies worth $175,000 to Nepal. The organization said this would cover the needs of 40,000 people for three months.Other than the injured, those rendered homeless by the earthquake are in need of immediate support for regular public health services, water and sanitation and psychological and social support to deal with the trauma caused by the tragedy, the WHO said.In addition to Israel, teams from India, Pakistan, the United States and China were already on the spot to help, according to the UN.Other international search teams are scheduled to arrive in Kathmandu, with units from Japan, the US and Britain equipped with sniffer dogs and equipment for heavy lifting.At least 6,000 people have been injured, according to the Nepalese government, and treating them and other survivors who are pulled from the wreckage remains a serious challenge.“The priority remains saving lives and immediate search and rescue ongoing,” said a report from the office of the UN Resident Coordinator in Nepal.Thousands of people in Kathmandu remained outside on Sunday in chilly temperatures and patchy rain, too afraid to return to their homes damaged by earthquake.The 7.9 magnitude earthquake, the strongest since 1934 when a similar intensity quake killed more than 10,000 people, struck the densely populated Kathmandu Valley on Saturday noon local time.There has been widespread damage and destruction of buildings, roads and other infrastructure, said aid workers, adding that more than 60 aftershocks, including a 6.7 magnitude quake on Sunday, had led to further devastation.The first 96 hours after the quake were critical, they said.“It’s already been over 24 hours.Every minute is precious for the people who are trapped under the rubble of buildings,” said Unni Krishnan, head of disaster response and preparedness for Plan International. “They are likely to be dehydrated, have breathing difficulties due to a lack of oxygen, injuries to head and spine and may be losing blood.”In Kathmandu Valley, hospitals are overcrowded and are running out of room for storing dead bodies, said aid workers, adding that hospitals were also running short of emergency supplies.Some are treating people in the streets.The UN Children’s Fund estimates at least 940,000 children have been severely affected in the area that includes Dhading, Gorkha, Rasuwa, Sindhupalchowk and Kathmandu districts.“This crisis leaves children particularly vulnerable – limited access to safe water and sanitation will put children at great risk from waterborne diseases, while some children may have become separated from their families,” UNICEF said.It has been difficult to assess the full scale of the disaster as many areas outside of Kathmandu are inaccessible due to damaged roads and landslides.Communications and electricity are intermittent.Compounding the matter, aid workers say their staff and even those trained in disaster response were themselves traumatized by the disaster and series of aftershocks, with some seeing their family members dying and their property destroyed.Assessments and coordination between aid agencies led by the Nepalese government are beginning to get underway and aid workers hoped to begin delivering emergency food rations, clean drinking water, blankets and tarpaulin sheets to survivors on Monday.Relief camps are likely to be established in coming days.“Hundreds of thousands are sleeping out in the open as they are too scared to go back in a building because of all the aftershocks,” said Oxfam India’s humanitarian manager Zubin Zaman.“It is cold, it is dark and it is now raining. They have no protection, no shelter. We need to move quickly.”Reuters contributed to this report.

How long can the government resist from investing in early warning systems, quake-resistant technology, compulsory drills in schools and offices, large-scale specialised training for disaster relief?

However, the convention attended by 2,000 tattoo artists from around the world - was cut short when the first tremors shook Kathmandu around 11.41 am.At the time, the duo was at Hotel Ambassador, where they were staying. When they saw the lobby's chandeliers shaking, they ran out onto the streets to see the enormous damage wrought by the quake. Ajmani, a Santacruz resident, said, "There were huge craters on the ground. One of the cracks ran through our hotel, splitting it in two. Everybody was panicking." She and Nag decided to head to Hotel Yak and Yeti, where the tattoo convention was being held. They had heard that other attendees were going to gather there and then go to Kathmandu Airport.They had to walk for miles to get there, as even when they managed to find a taxi, the roads were too congested. "Our only view en route was total destruction. There was a public hospital that had collapsed and people were dragging patients out from the rubble.The special forces were doing a commendable job of encouraging people and guiding them to the embassy," Nag an Andheri resident recalled. They reached the airport hours later, and finally checked in around 7.30 pm. But the ordeal was far from over; this was when they saw the people at their most vulnerable, said Ajmani.Most showed great lack of discipline and patience, and did not bother to help women, children or the elderly. "The authorities were calling out names of women, children and elderly who were to board the first flight to Delhi at 9 pm. But the people simply paid no heed and were forcing their way in.They almost ran over a six-year-old child in the stampede," she added. But if some were selfish, there were also those who were selfless. The child was saved by another youngster who got hurt in the process. A few guards and youths took charge of the situation and made a human chain, restricting the path of the crowd so people could board the plane in an orderly manner.Ajmani and Nag eventually boarded the third flight which left Kathmandu around 11.30 pm, after experiencing the trauma for nearly 12 hours. Now safe in Delhi and looking forward to returning home to Santacruz this evening, Ajmani said, "In those 12 hours, we saw the best and the worst of humanity. We learnt the value of human life and to what extent one would go to save it."

1959.txt:James Grieve, a British climber stranded on Mount Everest following earthquake-triggered avalanches, says there is a "race against time" for those awaiting rescue. He said that the rescue effort was being hampered by storms and supplies would only last a few more days. The 52-year-old told The Sun from Camp One: "Everyone is apprehensive about what's happening and what will happen in the next 24 hours. We have a few days of food and drink left. Our tents have all been lost and we have around 18 dead bodies at base camp. "Rescue teams are struggling to get us help due to the weather and the next few days' forecasts are not great. There is a lot of confusion in the cap and there are still about 120 of us here waiting to be rescued. "We are in a race against time to get off the mountain." He estimated up to 50 people had been killed. The paper said he was in a party with fellow British climbers Alex Staniforth, 19, of Chester, expedition leader Daniel Mazur, from Bristol and Sam and Alex Chappatte, from London. On Twitter yesterday, Mr Staniforth's UK-based support team revealed the difficulty caused by the weather. They said: "Alex has just texted via sat phone. They will spend another night at C1. Weather has drawn in making it too difficult to fly choppers." After the 6.7-magnitude aftershock, Mr Mazur tweeted: "Aftershock @ 1pm! Horrible here in camp 1. Avalanches on 3 sides. C1 a tiny island. We worry about icefall team below.. Alive?" He later said: "Icefall scouts back w/ news: GOOD: route is there. BAD: it sustained damage. V BAD: icefall Sherpas bc gone; ran away to Namche!"

1969.txt:Jakarta (Antara News) - As a country prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes, Indonesia has also felt the suffering of Nepalese whose country was devastated by a 7.9-magnitude earthquake on April 25, 2015.Soon after the news about the deadly quake reached Jakarta, the government expressed its deepest condolences over the heavy loss of lives, and offered US$ 1 million in humanitarian aid.Indonesia will also send a rescue team and extends moral support to the people of Nepal in facing the disaster, the government said in a press statement on April 26, 2015.The Indonesian Foreign Ministry has coordinated with relevant agencies in its plan to send humanitarian aid that includes medical personnel, SAR assistance, instant food, blankets, emergency tents and medicines, to Nepal, the statement said.The ministry also has coordinated with the Indonesian Embassy in Dhaka, Indonesian honorary consul in Kathmandu and several sides to monitor Indonesian citizens in Nepal."I have just told the ministers. Indonesia is ready to provide assistance," President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) told the press.The president estimated that relief aid from Indonesia for the victims in Nepal to arrive in three to four days, because the airport in Kathmandu was damaged by the earthquake.Jokowi affirmed that Indonesia that has experience in post-disaster work, such as after tsunamis and earthquakes, will not only provide aid but also send search and rescue and medical teams to the quake-hit areas in Nepal.The Indonesian government will dispatch the donation and a rescue team to Nepal when the airport of the country, which was hit by a massive earthquake, is repaired and able to receive airplanes.In addition, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs A. M. Fachir stated that the dispatch was hampered by a devastating landslide that damaged Nepals airport."The president has approved the sending of the donation and relief aid such as tents, blankets, and medicines. They are expected to be sent soon. However, the airport is damaged, not closed," Fachir noted."There is no access. The airport is not operational and the power supply is off," he pointed out.Once the airport resumes operations, the government will send assistance to Nepal immediately."The airport is most likely being repaired now. We will hopefully be able to dispatch the assistance soon," he remarked.An NGO, Quick Response Action (ACT), will soon send a team from Global Humanity Response (GHR) to help with earthquake relief efforts in Nepal."The team will conduct an initial assignment and recovery action in accordance with the priority needs of the Nepali people after the earthquake," the GHR director Imam Akbari said here on Monday, adding the team is scheduled to leave for Nepal on Monday night.As many as 3,218 people were killed and some 6,500 others injured in the powerful earthquake that struck Nepal at midday on Saturday, authorities were quoted as saying on Monday morning by Xinhua.The 7.9-magnitude quake jolted the central, western, mid-western and far-western parts of Nepal, which was followed by at least 15 strong aftershocks, with the last one of 6.7 magnitude occurring on April 26 afternoon.The quake has also caused property damages worth billions of US dollars in the country.Indonesian Foreign Affairs Minister Retno Marsudi said some 49 Indonesian citizens were in Nepal when the powerful earthquake jolted the country."Of the 49 Indonesian citizens in Nepal, 18 were settled there, while 31 others were on a visit," Retno Marsudi stating, adding that 19 of them had already been contacted, but the rest were unreachable as the communication links were disrupted due to the earthquake.But, another report said that the number of Indonesian nationals in Nepal was 34 when the quake struck the country.Of the total, 17 people were contacted, while the whereabouts of 17 others were still unknown, the foreign ministry remarked.The missing Indonesians include three climbers, who were last known to scale Yala Peak in the Langtang area, Nepal."The latest update is that we still cannot contact our friends who are in Nepal, not to mention the bad reception of cellular phones there," according to spokesman of the climbers hiking club crisis center, Grahito Handaru, in Bandung, West Java, on April 27, 2015.The three climbers identified as Jeroen Hehuwat, Kadek Andana, and Alma Parahita are the members of Bandungs Taruna Hiking Club."As per the last established contact, they had not yet reached the climbing area, but then the earthquake struck there," Grahito noted.According to Grahito, the three climbers, who left Indonesia for Nepal on May 19, 2015, were in Langtang Village to make the required preparations for the climb and had planned to head to Khyangin Gompa.The hiking clubs crisis center has been coordinating with the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Red Cross to locate the climbers, he said.According to Reuters, the powerful earthquake struck Nepal and sent tremors through northern India, toppling a 19th-century tower in the capital Kathmandu and touching off a deadly avalanche on Mount Everest.There were reports of devastation in outlying, isolated mountainous areas after the midday quake of magnitude 7.9, Nepals worst in 81 years, centred 50 miles (80 km) east of the second city, Pokhara.The media reported a collapse in communications hampered relief efforts, raising fears of a humanitarian disaster across the impoverished Himalayan nation of 28 million people.A tourism official said at least 10 people were killed when an avalanche unleashed by the earthquake swept through the Everest base camp, where more than 1,000 climbers had gathered at the start of the annual climbing season.Google executive Dan Fredinburg was among the dead on Mount Everest.A second tourism official, Mohan Krishna Sapkota, said it was "hard to even assess what the death toll and the extent of damage" around Everest could be."The trekkers are scattered all around the base camp and some had even trekked further up. It is almost impossible to get in touch with anyone," he was quoted as saying by Reuters. (*)F001/A/F001/A/H-YH) 27-04-2015 22:52:24

2078.txt:“There are cliffs on all sides and landslides,” she said, and explained that a member of their group suffered from a head wound. “Mother, how much longer until they rescue us?” she asked.According to the Foreign Ministry, their group are among 68 Israelis whose whereabouts are known, but for whom the damage from the earthquake has made it impossible to leave the isolated areas where they were trekking.In many cases, these individuals can only be rescued by helicopter, but very few are available and weather conditions have made such a mission almost impossible.A number of the families of these stranded trekkers met Monday afternoon at the Foreign Ministry to press Israeli officials to do more to bring their children home.Assurances by the ministry’s Director- General Nissim Ben-Shitrit that everything possible had been done and that millions of shekels had been spent on rescue efforts did little to relieve their anxiety.Sharon Shavit, whose daughter Shahar, 22, is with Shohat said that initially the group had notified their parents that they had survived the earthquake and explained that they were outside a guest house and had built a fire. It was only in the second message that they begged for help.There has been no follow-up message since, according to Shavit. “If they have to spend another night in the field I am not certain what will happen,” she said.Similarly Ido Veg heard from his younger sister, Tamar, 23, who is traveling with nine other Israelis in the area of Langtang.He has not spoken to her since the earthquake, but someone in her group managed to send a satellite message to a parent with information that everyone in their party was fine but that all paths out of the area were blocked.The tone changed just a day later, when a second message from the trekkers said they had a tent to sleep in but food for only two days.“They are next to a village that was totally destroyed,” Veg said.At night, someone is always awake watching over the others so quake survivors won’t steal what they have, he explained. It’s true, he said, that they have warm clothes, but added that there is heavy rain and “their food is about to finish.”“They are in a situation where everyone around them worries for themselves and we are worried for her,” Veg said.The families of the stranded Israeli trekkers have been bounced between the Foreign Ministry and their insurance companies, which have representatives on the ground and also are working on rescue efforts.Veg said he knows Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sent a message to his Nepalese counterpart, but questioned why he has not spoken publicly about the importance of rescuing these particular trekkers.“We have not seen the prime minister interviewed on the subject,” Veg said. His more basic question, however, is not about politics, but simply about how to save his sister.“Who is getting my sister out?” he asked.

2408.txt:As tragic as the losses are, it seems clear the city was not flattened. I’ve been struck by damage photos — not only the damage they show, but the damage they don’t show to apparently intact buildings in the background. This seems to go hand-in-hand with the ShakeMap, which is poorly constrained but shows intensities 7-8 in the near-field, not 9-10. I’m thinking it will be an interesting part of the earthquake story, understanding the ground motions in the near field. There should be at least some strong motion data from Katmandu, and maybe elsewhere. It kills me there isn’t more: I tried to put together a proposal a few years ago to install more dense low-cost accelerometers in the valley, working with NSET [Nepal’s National Society for Earthquake Technology] and Tribuvan University. I was involved with a proposal that went in a year or so ago…. I do think preparedness efforts made a difference. Amod Dixit and his team at NSET have worked tirelessly on outreach, education, and training. The population was not ignorant. Fatalism arises when problems are so far outside people’s control that they can’t do anything about it — or rather, they think they can’t do anything about it. And yes that paragraph is contradictory. The thing is, the overall problem was far outside anyone’s control but it is still possible to make some difference. Port-au-Prince is mostly the same story: big problems, big earthquakes, few resources. By my calculation, ground motions in Port-au-Prince were not intensity 9-10, but maybe 6-8. The story again was vulnerability.

2563.txt:KATHMANDU: Nishchal Guruwacharya does not believe in god anymore. The 25-year-old from Chamati area of Naya Bazar in Kathmandu lost more than half of his extended family of 52 in a building collapse on Saturday. That day, his family had organized a "saptahik pooja" in the house with almost all relatives in attendance."An entire generation is gone. My grandfather, my mother, all her sisters, my brother, everyone is gone. There were 40 people in the house then, only nine have survived. We were conducting the pooja to make the gods happy, they instead gave us their wrath," says Guruwacharya.A few kilometres away, recuperating from bruises and a head injury at a camp in Durbar area, Maheshwar Raj Khwanju, 48, is thanking the gods. His family of five fell five floors after his building in Bhotaiti collapsed, killing everyone except his wife and children.His daughter Asmita, 10, fainted out of shock as she felt the first tremors, but has not sustained even a scratch on her body. Even his dog Tommy escaped with just a limping leg. "This is god's grace, the power of Pashupatinath," says Khwanju.The only thing common between the two stories is the lament for an "absent" government and gratitude for the rescue and relief provided by India. Between the almighty's wrath and an overwhelmed Nepal government, India as the first mover seems to have made a place in the hearts of the Nepalese . This, despite the fact that there is no country worth any international standing that has not sent its teams to Nepal."Men from NDRF (National Disaster Response Force) have been working here non-stop, without a wink of sleep, for the past three days. I know none of my family members will come out alive. But at least they have ensured they will get a respectable funeral," says Guruwacharya.Though Khwanju was rescued by local youth, relief material and medical help brought in by Indian armed forces has kept him going in the camp.Srikrishna Kharel, 30, a cloth merchant from Hanuman Dhoka area which has seen massive damage to Nepal's architectural heritage, is doing his bit by helping people in a camp set up in the area. Like most caught in a tragedy, he is angry with his government."These people will do nothing for us. The first day there was no water, no food, no medicines. We have been surviving by helping each other. Indians were the first to come. Even before China. We haven't seen anyone from the US," he says.Though the Nepal government is doing its best, having put almost 90% of its army in rescue operations, it is certainly not enough given the scale of the tragedy. India on Tuesday sent three more NDRF teams with the number of teams engaged in rescue work now going up to 16.Tonnes of food, water, blankets and tents were unloaded from Indian aircraft at Tribhuvan International Airport even as aid poured in from across the world.What has marked India apart from all other international teams is articulated by a survivor of a six-storey building near Shobha Bhagwati bridge trapping over 50 who are all feared dead, "Teams from China and Poland had come. But they stay here for a few hours looking to rescue the living and leave when they are convinced all are dead. Only Indian forces are pulling out the dead," says Amir Sakya.Beyond their personal losses, the Nepalese are most saddened by the massive destruction to their cultural heritage. "Who will come to Nepal now," is the common refrain in a country heavily dependent on tourism."Do you know each and every brick of the temples in Hanuman Dhoka area that is now rubble had the names of the kings who contributed to their construction inscribed on them. Do you think when all this is rebuilt, its originality can be restored. No way. Guthibhairav temple was our Taj Mahal. It's gone. We have lost everything we had to show the world," says taxi driver Bose Kesi.

As the official death toll crossed 5,000, Nepal Prime Minister Sushil Koirala warned that the number of dead could reach 10,000 as information of damage from far-flung places has yet to come in. That would surpass the 8,500 who died in a 1934 earthquake. Releasing $15 million as emergency aid, the UN said 8 million people have been affected, and 1.4 million people are in need of food assistance in Nepal.News agency reports from near the quake epicentre detailed stories of survivors digging through rubble to look for dead bodies of loved ones, and of helicopters flying out the injured to Kathmandu.

He also took care of eight people with serious head injuries for about 14 hours before they were rescued via helicopters. Goel, 28, who is from Bangalore, joined the army six years ago.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has deputed four Union ministers to assess the loss of life and property in quake-hit areas of the country, especially Bihar, and oversee the relief and rescue operations there. While Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan is already deputed at the Indo- Nepal border and in overseeing relief operations in quake-hit areas, the other ministers deputed are Ananth Kumar, Radha Mohan Singh and J P Nadda.Ateam of Archaeological Survey of India will soon be visiting Nepal's Pashupatinath temple, to assess the damage and to begin the much promised restoration work. It was a crack in the stairs leading to one of the ghats at Pashupatinath temple that led Nepal government to ask for India's help to restore this World Heritage Site. In March 2013, ASI first team went to recce the monument.

2586.txt:New York (AFP) April 27, 2015 - The United States said Monday it is sending $10 million in relief to help the victims of the massive earthquake in Nepal, where the death toll surpassed 4,000, including at least four Americans. New York (AFP) April 27, 2015 - The United States said Monday it is sending $10 million in relief to help the victims of the massive earthquake in Nepal, where the death toll surpassed 4,000, including at least four Americans. The Pentagon also ordered about 24 US Army Green Beret commandos who were already in Nepal on training missions to join in rescue efforts, officials said. Some of the Green Beret special forces troops -- who were in Nepal for high-altitude training -- are helping to search for victims "along popular trekking routes" including the Mount Everest base camp route, spokesman Colonel Steven Warren told reporters. With fears rising of food and water shortages, US Secretary of State John Kerry and Pentagon chief Ashton Carter announced the latest details of the American aid effort, including a second military cargo flight to ferry rescue workers to Nepal. A C-17 Globemaster aircraft traveling from Dover Air Force Base in Delaware was carrying more than 50 search and rescue specialists from the Los Angeles County Fire Department, officials said. With that second flight, the United States would have "a nearly 130-person disaster response team" on the ground "to conduct assessments, coordinate the humanitarian response and provide search-and-rescue capabilities along with 45 tons of cargo," State Department spokesman Jeffrey Rathke said. A previous C-17 flight left on Sunday. Kerry offered his "deepest condolences" to the victims of the disaster in Nepal and across the region, adding "the images that everybody has seen are gut-wrenching, extraordinary devastation. The State Department confirmed that four Americans "in the Everest region" were among the dead. Speaking at a joint press conference with Kerry in New York, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said Tokyo was also sending some $8 million in aid to Nepal and had deployed 110 emergency workers. "Tragedies of this magnitude really underscore that in today's world, next door is really everywhere," Kerry said. Hundreds of thousands of Nepalis spent another night in the open Monday after a massive quake which killed more than 4,000, as officials warned the final toll could rise sharply once rescuers reach cut-off areas. With fears rising of food and water shortages, Nepalis were rushing to stores and petrol stations to stock up on essential supplies in the capital Kathmandu, left devastated by Saturday's 7.8-magnitude quake. Officials say more than 4,100 people are now known to have died, including 4,010 in Nepal -- making it the quake-prone Himalayan nation's deadliest disaster in more than 80 years. More than 90 people have been killed in neighbouring India and China while a further 7,500 people were injured in Nepal. But senior disaster management official Rameshwor Dangal said the toll in Nepal could jump once rescuers discovered the full extent of devastation in villages outside Kathmandu. "Rescue operations are underway, and in many places where buildings have collapsed there might be people trapped," Dangal, the home ministry's national disaster management chief, told AFP. "We are also in the process of getting information from villages, and these will add to the death toll." Families who work in Kathmandu were packing onto buses, some even sitting on the roofs, leaving the city, many for their home villages to determine the damage there. Mothers clutching children and men hauling bags were seen bargaining with drivers of the many buses clogging the roads out of the capital. The exodus came as international rescue teams with sniffer dogs raced to find survivors buried in rubble, and teams equipped with heavy cutting gear and relief supplies landed at the nation's only international airport. Elisabeth Byrs, a spokeswoman for the UN's World Food Programme, told AFP the agency would launch a "large, massive operation" with the first plane carrying rations set to arrive on Tuesday. Pledging $10 million in relief to help the victims, US Secretary of State John Kerry said he had been shocked by the "gut-wrenching" images of the death and destruction. Speaking at the same press conference, Japan's Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said that Tokyo was sending some $8 million in aid to Nepal. Hunkered in tent camps

2707.txt:(MENAFN - Khaleej Times) Hundreds of Nepalis, angered and frustrated by the government's slow response, were digging through rubble themselves on Tuesday to find remains of their loved ones after a devastating earthquake three days ago killed more than 4,000 people.International aid has finally begun arriving in the Himalayan nation of 28 million people but disbursement is slow. A Home Ministry official in the capital, Kathmandu, said the death toll from Saturday's 7.9 magnitude quake stood at 4,010, with 7,598 injured.Nepal's most deadly quake in 81 years also triggered a huge avalanche on Mount Everest that killed at least 17 climbers and guides, including four foreigners, the worst single disaster on the world's highest peak.A series of aftershocks, severe damage from the quake, creaking infrastructure and a lack of funds have slowed rescue efforts in the impoverished, mountainous country sandwiched between India and China."Waiting for help is more torturous than doing this ourselves," said Pradip Subba, searching for the bodies of his brother and sister-in-law in the debris of Kathmandu's historic Dharahara tower, a 19th century minaret that collapsed on Saturday as weekend sightseers clambered up its spiral stairs."Our hands are the only machine right now," said the 27-year-old, part of a group of locals pulling out blocks of concrete with cloth masks over their faces to ward off the stench of rotting bodies. "There is just no one from the government or the army to help us."Scores of people were killed in the collapse of the tower.The head of neighbouring India's National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), one of the first foreign organisations to arrive in Nepal to help in the search and rescue effort, said finding survivors and the bodies of the dead would take time.NDRF Director General O.P. Singh said heavy equipment could not fit through many of the narrow streets of Kathmandu."You have to remove all this rubble, so that will take a lot of time ... I think it's going to take weeks," he told Indian television channel NDTV late on Monday.Many people across Nepal slept in the open for a third night, their homes either flattened or threatened by tremors that spread more fear among a traumatised population.In Kathmandu, as elsewhere, thousands are sleeping on pavements, roads and in parks, many under makeshift tents.Hospitals are full to overflowing, while water, food and power are scarce, raising fears of waterborne diseases.There were some signs of normality on Tuesday, however, with fruit vendors setting up stalls on major roads and public buses back in operation.But with aid slow to reach many of the most vulnerable, some Nepalis were critical of the government."The government has not done anything for us," said Anil Giri, who was with about 20 volunteers looking for two of his friends presumed buried under rubble. "We are clearing the debris ourselves with our bare hands."OVERWHELMED, DESPERATEOfficials acknowledged they were overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster."The big challenge is relief," said Chief Secretary Leela Mani Paudel, Nepal's top bureaucrat."We urge foreign countries to give us special relief materials and medical teams. We are really desperate for more foreign expertise to pull through this crisis."At the Dharahara tower, Nepal's President Ram Baran Yadav told the local rescue team that he would send help.The situation is worse in remote rural areas. Highways have been blocked by landslides, and many villages and communities are without water and electricity, villagers surviving on salvaged food and with no outside help.While aid has begun arriving in the capital, including food, medical supplies, tents and dogs trained for rescue efforts, the authorities are struggling to deliver relief further afield.A crush at the main international airport, where relief material and rescue teams are flying in while thousands of residents are trying to leave, has slowed the flow of aid.India and China were among the first contributors to an international effort to support Nepal's stretched resources.On Monday, the United States announced an additional $9 million in aid for Nepal, bringing total U.S. disaster funding to $10 million.U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said two C-17 U.S. Air Force transport planes carrying search-and-rescue personnel and supplies were headed to Nepal. Australia is also sending a C-17 to deliver disaster relief supplies, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said, and to start ferrying out some of the more than 1,150 Australians who were in Nepal when the quake struck.High in the Himalayas, many sherpa mountain guides had descended to their homes and villages to see if loved ones were safe.Foreign mountaineers, meanwhile, were divided over whether to continue their pursuit of scaling the surrounding peaks if their local guides returned to lead them."For me personally it's probably too early to say how I feel about that," said Canadian Nick Cienski, who is attempting a record ascent of six 8,000-metre peaks this calendar year."I wouldn't want to continue if it made anybody uncomfortable to continue, sherpas included in that."As it happened10.00 a.m. (0415 GMT)Army troops are loading blue tarpaulin sheets, medical kits and dehydrated food, water bottles, sacks of rice and blankets at a flat area that is being used as a helipad in Gorkha town.Gorkha district was the epicenter of Saturday's magnitude 7.8 earthquake that has killed more than 4,300 people.With the weather clearing it seems that for now helicopters will be able to pick up the supplies and relay to smaller villages.The weather has been erratic over the last two days - there has been some rain and cloud cover making it difficult for helicopters to land in some areas close to the epicenter.9.45 a.m. (0400 GMT)A team of 37 New Zealand urban search-and-rescue experts due to leave Monday night for Kathmandu has been told at the 11th hour not to come.New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully said in a statement that Nepal's government had informed him they had enough expertise in the country and the team was no longer required.New Zealand has contributed 1 million New Zealand dollars ($761,000) to the relief effort following Saturday's earthquake that killed more than 4,300 people.9.30 a.m. (0345 GMT)Army troops are loading bags of rice and cornmeal into a storage room at the district headquarters in Gorkha, the epicenter of Saturday's massive earthquake.District official Surya Mohan Adhikari says the supplies will be sent out later in the day to villages that need them most.He said that in the rural areas 90 percent of the people have been affected "by this calamity. They have lost their homes and livestock. They have no way of getting food."He says it is very difficult to reach them. They are cut off by landslides on the mountain roads, and the wind and rain is making it difficult for helicopters to land.Adhikari said they have reports of some 300 casualties, but that number is rising. Nationwide, more than 4,300 people have been killed in the magnitude 7.8 quake.9.00 a.m. (0315 GMT)A Nepal police official says at least 4,352 bodies have so far been recovered after last week's massive earthquake that struck just outside of capital Kathmandu.Deputy Inspector General of Police Komal Singh Bam says the toll includes 1,176 bodies recovered in Sindhupalchuk district, just northeast of the capital.He says 8,063 people have been injured in the magnitude 7.8 quake.Another 18 people were also killed in a quake-triggered avalanche that swept the Everest base camp. In neighboring India 61 people were killed and China's official Xinhua News Agency reported 25 dead in Tibet.8.45 a.m. (0300 GMT)A local seismologist says major aftershocks are now unlikely to occur as the 72-hour mark after Saturday's devastating earthquake approaches.Lok Bijaya Adhikari, chief of Nepal's National Seismological Center, says the number and strength of aftershocks have been receding. There have been more than 100 aftershocks since Saturday's magnitude 7.8 temblor that left more than 4,300 people confirmed dead so far. The largest of these was magnitude 6.7 on Sunday.The ground shook Tuesday morning at 5 a.m. but measured only magnitude 4.5.Smaller aftershocks are expected to continue for a month and Kathmandu residents could continue to feel tremors because the epicenter is close to the city.8.15 a.m. (0230 GMT)Health workers fear a major health crisis among the survivors of Saturday's massive earthquake who are living in the open or in crowded tents with no access to sanitation or clean water.Baburam Marasini, director of Nepal's Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, says their main concern is making sure people get clean water.He says "we fear diseases." He says the department is asking people to take precautions such as eating with a clean spoon and not with their hands as most people here normally do.He says people are also being asked to drink clean water. Attempts are also being made to reach rural areas quickly where a clear picture of the death toll - now more than 4,300 - is still not available.8.15 a.m. (0230 GMT)A government official says business owners are being asked to open their shops amid anxiety among locals about dwindling food and medical supplies in the wake of Saturday's earthquake that has left more than 4,300 people dead.Naindra Prasad Upadhaya, an official at the Commerce and Supplies Ministry says the government has made arrangements to pick up food and supplies directly from factories and distribute them free in areas where necessary.Water has been the big issue. There will be more tankers bringing water to the areas where people are camped out in Kathmandu and surrounding areas, he says. Food will also be sent to the rural areas on helicopters, he says.Police are on the lookout for businesses that are overcharging to take advantage of demand and scarcity, and such people will be arrested and punished, he said.
2708.txt:MUMBAI: Phones are ringing off the hook at insurance companies and page views have surged at websites offering policies to cover homes and their contents. The earthquake that tore through Nepal on April 25, killing thousands and reducing scores of buildings to rubble has led to a surge in enquiries about home insurance policies in India.Such policies are of two types —one covers the structure and construction costs in the event of damage to the property due to natural calamities while the other insures belongings and household contents."There is a spike in demand and this will stay for a short time," said Tapan Singhel, managing director and CEO of Bajaj Allianz General Insurance . "We have seen a similar spurt in the past — during the Jammu & Kashmir floods, the Uttarakhand floods and the Sikkim earthquake." As with all forms of insurance in India, home cover is also sparse. The number of insured homes is estimated at 20 lakh with annual premiums adding up to Rs 2,500 crore.At the time of the 2011 census, India had 33 crore homes, of which only half are of 'pukka' construction, or permanent in nature.There is huge potential in the segment, with average premiums seen going up to as much as Rs 3 lakh, according to industry estimates. "Suddenly there is a spike in enquires, but conversion into a sale is hampered due to lack of widespread distribution," said Sanjay Datta, head of underwriting at ICICI Lombard General Insurance.Due to lack of awareness, companies are unable to capture demand. That may change following the devastation in Nepal.Industry executives said that those residing in seismic zones need to buy home insurance to protect themselves.Policies pay for damage to property and contents due to natural or man-made calamities, including earthquakes. Rates vary from 70 paise to Rs 1 per cover of Rs 1,000, depending on the area and the frequency. Many banks and housing finance companies insulate themselves from such possible risks by making home insurance mandatory for mortgage customers.A standard clause in most home loan contracts is that the mortgaged house should be insured against natural calamities, including earthquakes. If borrowers fail to insure their property, the bank debits the premium to the loan account of the borrower and pays for the premium.

278.txt:''Oh ! God.. this is Nepal earthquake ..!!! I shot a song here for 'Mahaan' with Zeenat Aman .. pray all well,'' tweeted Amitabh Bachan instantly after the earthquake that swept the entire country of Nepal including the Northern parts of India and the adjacent countries of Bangladesh and Malaysia.The nine-storey Dharahara Tower and the royal Durbar Square, the major tourist attractions in Kathmandu once thronged by tourists from across the globe are the heaps of rubble now. More than 700 have already died and reports of more and more death are coming. Providing a panoramic view of Kathmandu valley, a place which once was a must visit place for every traveller to Nepal, has turned into a heap of rubble. The Dharahara Tower in Kathmandu was the second such tower built by Bhimsen Thapa. The first tower was built eight years earlier in 1824 and was 11 stories high, two stories taller than the Dharahara. Dharahara is said to be built for Queen Lalit Tripura Sundari, who was the niece of Bhimsen Thapa. During the earthquake of 1834, both the towers survived, but the first Bhimsen's tower suffered severe damage. On the fateful day 15 January 1934 the first tower was destroyed completely while the second one suffered the major damages. Restoration of this tower were carried out under the rule of the then Prime Minister of Nepal, Juddha Shumsher who got it renovated to its previous form in 1936. While the original Bhimsen Tower was wiped off, Queen Lalit Tripura Sundari's tower got its name, 'Bhimsen Stambha' or 'Bhimsen Tower'. The Dharahara Tower was actually built as a watch tower for military. It turned into one of the key landmarks in Kathmandu later. Possessing a spiral staircase which lead to the circular balcony on the eight floor used to provide mesmerising view of the Kathmandu Valley.Another structure, Kathmandu Durbar Square, the plaza in front of the old royal palace of the former Kathmandu Kingdom. It was one of three Durbar (royal palace) Squares in the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal, all of which were part of, till Saturday Morning, the UNESCO World Heritage Site. The beautiful setting of an open-air plaza consisting of temples, idols and fountains, a statue of Lord Hanuman standing in the square, the monkey devotee of Lord Ram, at the entrance of the palace, buildings in the Durbar Square all reduced to rubble when they collapsed on the fateful day of 25 April 2015, in one of the worst earthquakes that have hit this mountainous region. Once filled with tourists and people crazy for mountains, coming to this place from across the globe, the bustling city of Kathmandu is a city filled with sorrow. Not only has it's landscape changed but many lives also changed, forever.The Kathmandu Valley includes seven groups of monuments that showcase a range of religious and artistic traditions that have made the area world famous. UNESCO says the most well-known are tiered temples made of fired brick and timber. "The roofs are covered with small overlapping terracotta tiles, with gilded brass ornamentation. The windows, doorways and roof struts have rich decorative carvings. The stupas have simple but powerful forms with massive, whitewashed hemispheres supporting gilded cubes with the all-seeing eternal Buddha eyes," says UNESCO in a description of the heritage structures in Kathmandu valley, mostly linked to the Hindu religion. Right in the aftermath of the earthquake on Saturday, Australian journalist Siobhan Heanue's tweets reflected the fear, chaos and the enormity of the tragedy that struck the Himalayan nation.Journalists from Nepal also took to twitter to show their despair in losing these heritage of their country to the devastating earthquake.

2800.txt:CHENNAI: From mobilising medical supplies to offering their service, doctors and hospitals in Chennai and other parts of the state are pitching in with relief operations for quake-hit Nepal.On Monday, the Tamil Nadu chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) sent out emails and text messages to its members seeking volunteers to help with the relief operations in Nepal. Around 40 doctors have signed up so far."Every time there has been a natural calamity, doctors here have been quick to offer support," said IMA Tamil Nadu general secretary Dr C N Raja. "We have sent out on an appeal to our members to give financial aid and volunteer in relief operations there. The list of doctors will be sent to IMA, Delhi, which will coordinate with the National Disaster Management Authority," he added.Dr Binu Lal Singh, a doctor from Kanyakumari, has signed up for the operations. "The scenes from the spot were heart wrenching. They clearly need more skilled hands there. I didn't think twice when I got the message from IMA. I immediately gave my name," said Dr Singh, who has been practising for 17 years.The IMA has already sent four medical teams of doctors, pharmacists and aid workers from Delhi. "We are in the process of forming more teams. We are also in constant touch with the Nepal medical association," said Dr J A Jayalal, a senior IMA member, adding that essential drugs and surgical equipment have also been sent out. The doctors will work with the National Disaster Response Force teams. "So far, the report the doctors have given us is appalling. Several are yet to be rescued. The rain has hampered relief operations and raised the risk of infections," said Jayalal.In Chennai, we are forming a team of general physicians and emergency workers. How we work is that we set up a base camp in Uttarakhand and coordinated with the Army. We will leave to Nepal in a week. First team from the SEWA project will comprise doctors from Delhi and then the regional teams will follow" said Harish Manian, facility director of Fortis Malar. While hospitals and doctors are gearing to pitch in, a senior official in the state government who is familiar with handling disasters said that volunteers in their zeal can be a liability instead of an asset. "We need to support the country and the people, not overwhelm them. The problem is we forget to be practical in our enthusiasm. As we go through the initial phase of a disaster, it is always better to wait for the rapid needs and damage assessment rather than rushing to the spot," said the official.The scenes from the spot were heart wrenching. They clearly need more skilled hands there. I didn't think twice when I got the message from IMA. I immediately gave my name Dr Binu Lal Singh

2930.txt:Siddhartha’s mother, Queen Maya Devi, is said to have given birth on the site now marked by Lumbini’s Mayadevi Temple and to have bathed her infant son in its adjacent pool. The ancient part of the site — there are many new temples and monasteries surrounding it — also includes a sacred Bodhi tree, the same type of tree the Buddha is said to have sat under when he attained enlightenment. Archaeologists have found evidence of worshippers at this site as early as 1000 B.C., perhaps members of a pre-Buddhist tree-worshipping sect. The extent of the damage at Lumbini is not yet known because of the difficulty of getting in and out of the area.

The stupa, which is domelike and sits under the spire — is reported to have survived with some damage.

The bulk of the survivors flew out of Kathmandu on an El Al jumbo jet that landed at Ben-Gurion Airport around noon on Tuesday.After their departure, Israel turned its focus to rescuing the trapped trekkers and offering humanitarian assistance to the Nepalese, who are struggling to treat more than 9,000 victims. At least 5,000 people have died in the quake and that number is expected to double as rescuers – including Israeli teams – continue to sift through the rubble.Prime Minister Sushil Koirala told Reuters the death toll could reach 10,000, as information on damage from farflung villages and towns has yet to come in.Israel’s “top priority is to locate and extricate Israelis in distress and to help them return safely to Israel,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said as he held high-level consultations in his Jerusalem office to assess the situation.There are also approximately nine Israelis who are unaccounted for, and an additional six whose whereabouts were initially known but with whom contact has since been lost.Most of the trekkers awaiting rescue are in the areas of Langtang, Mt. Everest, Annapurna, and Pokhara. In many cases they can only be were now safely in a Nepalese army base.To hear Shani’s voice after three anxious days was an “incredible feeling” that made me want to cry, Elsie told The Jerusalem Post hours later.“It is beyond words,” she said.“From the time my friend called me and told me about the earthquake until the time I got a message from Shani, my body and mind froze.”The nightmarish situation was made somewhat easier by Shani’s decision to bring a satellite phone with her to Nepal to be in touch with her mother. She was the only one in her larger group of 100 international travelers to have a satellite phone, Elsie said.Immediately after the quake, Shani messaged her parents to let them know she and everyone in her group had survived and that no one was injured. They were only four hours into their trek and had stopped to have lunch when the ground shook beneath them, Elsie said.In a message that followed, Shani told her mother: “We found cover and are waiting for rescue.”Elsie suddenly understood that the group had not understood the magnitude of the disaster they had survived.“The situation is not good,” Elsie wrote back to Shani. “Kathmandu was hit badly. There is no water and no electricity. The airport is closed.You need to prepare for being there for a week.”As her daughter waited for rescue, Elsie was busy acting as a one-woman messaging service. She became the contact person for the Israeli group, updating the families of the other trekkers.Elsie created a WhatsApp group for them, but didn’t stop there. She also was in contact with many of the families of the internationals in Spain and with local Nepalese in the nearby village. One of them even contacted her. Elsie said her phone number was circulated on Facebook and on the radio.Although there were media reports of violence between Israeli trekkers and Nepalese citizens, her daughter’s experience was the complete opposite, Elsie said. The group bonded with the nearby villagers as they all worked to survive. The trekkers cleared an open space so the helicopter could land and devised a way to purify water so they could drink, Elsie said. The two Israelis, internationals and locals slept together and ate together, Elsie said.“By Monday I could tell... they were getting scared,” Elsie said. “There were so many aftershocks. The ground was constantly rumbling underneath them and they were running low on food. It scared them to death.”One member of the group had insurance from Harel, Elsie said. Even though it was not her insurance company, Harel was in constant contact with her because of Shani’s satellite phone. They phoned her several times a day.At 4:30 a.m., they were the ones who called to tell her the helicopters were on their way. Shani flew out on one, but left her satellite phone with two Israelis who will be rescued only on Wednesday.Elsie said her daughter is now in a Nepalese army camp, where she plans to remain until her two friends are saved as well.“I feel better,” Elsie said. “But I will feel a lot better when she is out of Kathmandu.”

2.txt:Kathmandu (AFP) April 25, 2015 - An historic 19th-century tower collapsed in the heart of Kathmandu's old quarter after an earthquake on Saturday, with at least a dozen bodies seen pulled from the rubble and fears of scores still trapped. Kathmandu (AFP) April 25, 2015 - An historic 19th-century tower collapsed in the heart of Kathmandu's old quarter after an earthquake on Saturday, with at least a dozen bodies seen pulled from the rubble and fears of scores still trapped. The nine-storey Dharhara tower is a major tourist attraction in Durbar Square at the heart of Kathmandu's historic old city where kings were once crowned, with its eighth-floor balcony providing panoramic views of the Kathmandu valley. The tower -- which was white, topped with a bronze minaret and contained a spiral staircase of over 200 steps -- was reduced to just its base when the 7.8-magnitude quake struck at lunchtime. Rescue workers were seen dragging bodies from the rubble and TV footage showed chaotic scenes at the site, as people desperately tried to dig through piles of bricks and dust with their bare hands. Kathmandu police spokesman Dinesh Acharya said rescuers were frantically trying to "bring everyone out to safety". "Our team is still deployed in Dharara to rescue people. However, we do not know how many are still trapped," he told AFP. People took to social media to express their dismay at the historic site's collapse. "Devastating to see Dharhara (Bhimsen Tower) collapsed," user Prabir Bhatt said on Twitter. "The historic #Dharhara tower in #Nepal destroyed by the #Earthquake. Prayers!" wrote Rahul Sharma. Saturday was not the first time the 50.5-metre-high tower -- built by Nepal's then prime minister for the queen in 1832 -- has been hit by an earthquake. Much of Durbar Square, a UNESCO World Heritage site and the social and cultural heart of the city, had to be rebuilt after a huge quake in 1934. The tower collapsed in that quake and was rebuilt two stories lower than the original. The tower was a popular attraction, with tourists charged a small fee to climb the steps to the viewing deck. A small shrine to the Hindu god Shiva was located at the top. The Wikipedia page for the tower was updated within minutes after the earthquake hit, with the news of its collapse. A massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake killed hundreds of people Saturday as it ripped through large parts of Nepal, toppling office blocks and towers in Kathmandu and triggering an avalanche that hit Everest base camp. Officials said at least 449 people are known to have died in Nepal but that the toll could be much higher, while more than two dozen people were also reported killed in neighbouring India, China and Bangladesh. "The death toll based on information received on our network across the country has reached 449," Nepal's national police spokesman Kamal Singh Bam told AFP. "Deaths have been reported from all regions except the far west. All our security personnel have been deployed to rescue and assist those in need." Officials said an avalanche had buried parts of Mount Everest's base camp in Nepal where hundreds of mountaineers have gathered at the start of the annual climbing season. "An avalanche from Mt. Pumori has hit the base camp, burying a part of it," Gyanendra Kumar Shrestha, an official in Nepal's tourism department, told AFP. "We are trying to assess how many are injured. There might be over 1,000 people there right now, including foreign climbers and Nepalese supporting staff." AFP Nepal bureau chief Ammu Kannampilly, on an assignment to Everest, was among those caught up in the chaos and reported that snowfall meant it was impossible for helicopters to reach the area. Two experienced mountaineers said that panic erupted at base camp which was full of climbing teams and had been "severely damaged", while one said the quake triggered a "huge avalanche". -- Historic tower collapses -- But the worst damage was reported in Kathmandu, where the historic nine-storey Dharahara tower, a major tourist attraction, was among the buildings to have been brought down. At least a dozen bodies were taken away from the ruins of the 19th century tower, according to an AFP photographer who saw similar scenes of multiple casualties in other parts of the city. While contact with Nepal was sporadic, a senior Nepalese diplomat warned that the final toll could run into many hundreds. "We have received reports that there is a big loss of property and life in Nepal," Krishna Prasad Dhakal, the deputy chief of mission at Nepal's Embassy in New Delhi, told AFP. "Possibly hundreds of people have died in various parts of the country, particularly in Kathmandu and Pokhara." At least 26 people were known to have died in India, including 17 in the eastern state of Bihar, while buildings in the capital New Delhi had to be evacuated. The United States Geological Survey and India's meteorological service said the shallow quake struck 77 kilometres (48 miles) northwest of Kathmandu at 0611 GMT, with walls crumbling and families racing outside their homes. "The walls of houses have collapsed around me onto the road. All the families are outside in their yards huddled together," an AFP reporter said in Kathmandu. Another resident recounted scenes of panic and mayhem. "Everything started shaking. Everything fell down. The walls around the main road have collapsed. The national stadium's gates have collapsed," Anupa Shrestha said. The quake tore through the middle of highways in the capital and also caused damage to the country's only international airport which was briefly closed. Kari Cuelenaere, an official at the Dutch embassy, said the impact had swept the water out of a swimming pool at a Kathmandu hotel where Dutch national day was being celebrated. "It was horrible, all of a sudden all the water came up out of the pool and drenched everyone, the children started screaming," Cuelenaere told AFP. "Some parts of the city fell down, there was dust rising... There were many (rescue) helicopters. Aftershock tremors could be felt more than two hours after the initial quake. Initially measured at 7.5 magnitude, the quake was later adjusted to 7.8, with a depth of 15 kilometres, the USGS said. It hit 73 kilometres east of the tourist town of Pokhara. - Tremors felt across region - Witnesses and media reports said the tremors lasted between 30 seconds and two minutes. "We are in the process of finding more information and are working to reach out to those affected, both at home and in Nepal," Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet. The AFP office in Delhi was evacuated twice following the quake. China's official Xinhua news agency said that two people, including an 83-year-old woman, were killed in the Tibet region as a result of the quake. The earthquake was also felt across large areas of Bangladesh, triggering panic in the capital Dhaka as people rushed out onto the streets. In the garment manufacturing hub of Savar, on the outskirts of Dhaka, at least 50 workers were injured after the quake set off a stampede in a garment factory, according to the private Jamuna television. The area has a history of earthquakes, with a 6.8 magnitude quake that hit eastern Nepal in August 1988 killing 721 people. A magnitude 8.1 quake killed 10,700 people in Nepal and eastern India in 1934. Deadliest earthquakes of the past 30 years
3009.txt:Sri Lankan Rescue Contingent Braves Rainy Weather & Treats More Than 300, Accommodating Earthquake Victims in Own Tents The first rescue and relief contingent from Sri Lanka with 44 service personnel and 4 civil medical consultants, dispatched to Nepal Sunday (26) early morning on the directions of the President and the Prime Minister with close supervision of the Commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Crishanthe De Silva, in less than 45 minutes of their arrival in Nepal, has begun their rescue and relief operations from Dolalghad, a remote worst-affected area, about 60 km away from Kathmandu, Nepal. The contingent, commanded by Major General Maithri Dias remains deployed in Dolalghad area on the advice of the Nepalese Army and other ministerial authorities, has by Tuesday (28) noon, treated more than 300 badly injured victims in the devastating earthquake, including a woman whose spinal cord suffered complete damage after she remained buried alive for many hours. The Sri Lankan contingent was compelled to walk about 12 km before she was rescued and subsequently dispatched to the Kathmandu General Hospital Monday (27) afternoon. The full Sri Lankan contingent, numbering 160 personnel comprises of Engineer troops, Commandos, medical consultants, paramedics and sniffer dogs and two more remaining relief teams are expected to leave for Nepal within next few hours. Taking a personal interest, Lieutenant General Crishanthe De Silva, Commander of the Army who has been in constant touch with the Army contingent round the clock, has given approval for the contingent to pocket out own financial resources for hire of private vehicles, deemed essential for emergency requirements of the victims and dispatch of the injured. So far, the Army contingent, hiring private vehicles, has already transported victims to hospitals two times since the dearth of vehicles, reluctance of vehicle owners for passage as well as continuous torrential downpour, has badly restricted movements into certain affected areas, according to the Contingent Commander Major General Maithri Dias. Similarly, Sri Lankan contingent, including Engineer troops are busily engaged in putting up temporary shelters for the victims after restoring pipe-borne water systems in some affected areas, mainly due to prevailing acute shortage of drinking water. The Sri Lankan contingent, despite chilly inclement weather, has been restricted to a few tents on the banks of a river in the mountainous area as some of the tents, meant for their own use also, had to be given away to the most needed victims, including kids and old folk and for conduct of necessary first aid practices and medical consultations.

301.txt:While the extent of the damage and the scale of the disaster are yet to be ascertained, the quake will likely put a huge strain on the resources of this poor country best known for Everest, the highest mountain in the world, and its rich Hindu culture. The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, is heavily dependent on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain climbing.
301.txt:A magnitude 7 quake is capable of widespread and heavy damage while an 8 magnitude quake can cause tremendous damage.
301.txt:“It’s too early to make any assessment but the damage isn’t as bad as it could have been,” said Liz Satow, the Nepal director for the aid group World Vision. She said she drove from Kathmandu to the nearby town of Lalitpur and said that while there was considerable damage, most buildings were still intact.
301.txt:India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi called a meeting of top government officials to review the damage and disaster preparedness in parts of India that felt strong tremors. The Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Sikkim, which share a border with Nepal, have reported building damage. There have also been reports of damage in the northeastern state of Assam.
3030.txt:Relief and rehabilitation of quake-hit Nepal is going to take months and perhaps years and it is going to be a very expensive affair. The US Geological Survey has estimated that the total damage could cost anywhere between $100 million to $10 billion, an astronomical sum for a country like Nepal where the per capita income is a meagre $62.50 per month.
3035.txt:Sources said the team will coordinate with the Nepalese government in the salvage operation and assess the damage.

He said it is devastated knowing how many people have perished in the quake. He said it is also hard watching all of the footage of the damage because he said these are areas and landmarks he grew up around.
304.txt:The best we can do is wait to hear from the team. I’m certain Ronnie will contact us as soon as possible. It could well be that communication is problematic as a result of damage caused by the earthquake. We hope for the best and are thinking of them.''

3072.txt:The anguish is underscored by the damage the earthquake did to some of the country’s foundations. It destroyed the Kasthamandap temple, leaving its centuries-old square timbers in a pile of rubble. Kathmandu was named after the temple, and its destruction has laid the symbolic heart of the city to waste.
3072.txt:At the city’s main bus nexus in Kalanki Chowk, thousands crowd onto sidewalks waiting to leave town. Operators have raised fares six-fold and begun charging the same rates for perilous seats on the roof. They are still selling out, leaving nothing for Ishwor Chalise, a 26-year-old English student looking to go to his home nearly 400 kilometres away, where the earthquake caused no damage. “To be safe, I want to go there,” he said.
3073.txt:Q: Head of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources of the Philippines reportedly said that China's construction on the islands and reefs of Nansha caused damage to the local coral reef and affected the livelihood of the Philippine fishermen. Does China have any response?
3073.txt:A: China exercises indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and the adjacent waters. China carries out construction on its own islands and reefs, and attaches greater importance to protecting the ecological environment there than anyone else. One thing worth pointing out is that China's construction projects have gone through years of scientific assessments and rigorous tests, and are subject to strict standards and requirements of environmental protection. Such projects will not damage the ecological environment of the South China Sea. Philippines' argument that China's construction on the islands and reefs would cause damage to the Philippines is utterly unjustifiable.
3075.txt:The government has yet to assess the full scale of the damage.
3076.txt:After centuries of being closed to Christianity, and with virtually no churches, Nepal has begun to open up to the faith. By 2010 there were more than 850,000 Christ-followers in nearly 10,000 groups. Community radio stations planted by local ministry partners and supported by the international media and medical mission agency, Reach Beyond, have played an important role in bringing the "good news" to the country. Eight FM stations, most of which are located near the epicenter of the quake, are now being assessed for what is expected to be extensive damage.
3077.txt:The 7.9 magnitude earthquake was the biggest disaster to hit Nepal in over 80 years… and the government has yet to assess the full scale of the damage.
3078.txt:According to Emergency Management BC, the province experiences an average 2,500 quakes a year. Many are felt but only a handful cause damage beyond some rattling chinaware.
3078.txt:By contrast, The Big One could be in the range of magnitude 9.0, more than 10 times as big as the Nepal quake. Depending on the location, it could cause widespread damage in southwestern B.C. to buildings and infrastructure such as roads, bridges, sewer, water and power supplies.
3078.txt:Bird said the level of damage depends heavily on how deep the source of the quake is. Deep quakes give the seismic waves a chance to disperse and weaken as they’re transmitted up through the Earth’s crust.
3078.txt:“They’re held up by gravity,” she said. “You’re just sort of stacking things like a house of cards, so when strong horizontal forces come from the earthquake it causes pancaking and fairly devastating damage, which is not what we would tend to see here.”

3102.txt:Over many years, Wyss has provided emergency aid agencies and nonprofit groups with rapid initial death and damage estimates and maps in the hours or days following big earthquakes. The calculations are made by comparing earthquake motion and huge global databases of population density and construction methods and quality — or more commonly, the lack of quality. Read “Buildings as Weapons of Mass Destruction” by Roger Bilham and Vinod Gaur to get the idea.
3102.txt:Q. This earthquake reminds me of Kashmir, the 2005 Pakistan quake, which was mostly rural [and killed more than 79,000 people]. A. That’s right. And in fact, …the population in villages is actually the equivalent or greater [than in the city of Katmandu]. And the point about this is that the villages are still constructing out of rubble and clay and even the wood they used to have in their structures has been in short supply. One has to expect that that last 10 years of building in the villages, at least, they will have had inferior quality instead of better-quality building. In Katmandu itself there’s been a trend to concrete frame everywhere. there are some very opulent houses that have been constructed quite well, actually. The old city has very narrow streets and they have overhanging balconies and most are them are really congested with people. The buildings are assembled largely out of bricks and wood recovered from the 1934 earthquake, and rebuilt every earthquake that’s happened. Probably many of them were rebuilt from bricks that were used prior to the 1833 earthquake which destroyed the city. There’s been reclaiming of materials and no change in building designs. But the building design changes came with the absence of wood, and that probably started more than 40 years ago. And all new construction is concrete frame. If that is assembled correctly, it’s fine. If not assembled correctly, it’s a problem, too. Looking at all these different kinds of buildings you can see some survived and some didn’t. I was looking at some YouTube videos, and you can see a swimming pool sloshing around. It’s almost better than strong-motion seismometer. Because you can see the water is shifted laterally and comes up in gigantic waves on each side. It’s the first pulse that really did the damage, as always. The rupture propagated from the west quite fast, about 2.5 kilometers per second, in some places faster. You get to Katmandu and everything slows down as it passes under the valley at about 1 kilometer per second. That means there are some heterogeneities along the base of the Himalayas that are modulating the slip in these very large earthquakes.

3217.txt:MIRIK (DARJEELING): Mirik is no stranger to earthquakes, but three tremors in as many days has shaken up the sleepy hill town like never before. Since the Nepal quake that struck on Saturday afternoon, Mirik has been rocked routinely once every day. The last one on Monday evening turned out to be the most severe, making houses and buildings tremble more vigourously.Thousands in the town have been sleeping in tents at night, out in the open, fearing a repeat of the tremor. Rumours of an impending disaster are flying around even as tourists keep streaming out of hotels and lodges.On Tuesday afternoon, Mirik looked like a ghost town. Most hotels have either been emptied or shut down. Shops opened for a few hours in the afternoon, but most downed shutters by early evening. Residents have been keeping indoors till evening and spending the nights out in the open. SSB forces are ready to swing into action if a calamity strikes.Rakesh Golay, an ex-armyman, has spent the last three nights in an open area adjacent to his house atop a picturesque hill at Nigalay, 5km from Mirik town. His two children, wife and brother jostle under a tarpaulin sheet every night. Golay's neighbor Biren Pradhan hasn't slept since Saturday. Every night he keeps vigil along with a band of youngsters. "Earthquakes can't be predicted. So, the only way is to warn people as fast as we can. But it's extremely tiring and I feel exhausted now after spending sleepless nights," he said. At Okayti Tea Estate, labourers are yet to get over the shock of Monday's tremor. Sangita Sewa, an estate worker, was doing her household chores when she heard a thunderous clatter around 5.30pm. Even before she could look out of her kitchen window, the wall started giving way. "The bricks tumbled out of the wall as if it had been rammed. I cowered under a table and it blew over in a few seconds. The tremors also left numerous cracks all over the house," said Sangita.The district administration hasn't yet been able to reach out to the quake affected zones around Mirik. Some panchayat representatives have only done a sketchy survey of the damage, said villagers. But no real help has reached any village. Hundreds don't have tarpaulin sheets to sleep under.SSB commandant Manoj Kumar, who is leading a team engaged in area assessment, said he had never seen such widespread panic in the hills. "Aftershocks are rarely so severe! But since you can't predict them, we must keep fingers crossed," he said.

The spring is stuck on a broad, rough surface which we call a fault plane," Stark said.Sometimes, energy stored in the spring gets big enough to slip catastrophically, releasing all that pent-up strain and generating shaking strong enough to destroy buildings and kill people over a huge area, he explained.The bigger the area that slips, and the larger the pent-up energy, the greater the damage.The death toll in Nepal's devastating earthquake today crossed 4,350, with more than 8,000 people injured.

3401.txt:Power lines are down, communication is shoddy and the roads are treacherous. People are living in the open or staying in crowded tents -- that's what the news stories say, at least.A group of Nepalis from North Texas will see the damage and the desperation firsthand when they travel to Nepal this week to provide medical assistance to survivors.The journey to Nepal, however, isn't easy. Relief groups have had limited access to impacted areas because of damaged roads and poor weather conditions.The team of 15 medical professionals -- doctors and nurses -- will leave town Wednesday and take 22 hours of connecting flights to Kathmandu, Nepal's capital.Once there, they will board helicopters provided by the Nepalese Army to get to the Gorkha district, the 7.8-magnitude quake's epicenter.They plan to set up a medical camp where they will also distribute food and clothing, said Bal Joshi, vice president of the Irving-based Nepalese Society of Texas.The volunteers realize their plan won't be easy to execute, but they all speak Nepali, are familiar with the country's geography, and have contacts who can help get supplies from neighboring India if needed, Joshi said.While the team establishes its workflow in Nepal, the Nepalese community here in the Dallas area will continue collecting money and supplies to send to them.The requested items: surgical disposables such as dressing sets and gowns; tourniquets; portable suction units; laryngoscopes; portable stretchers; hand-held pulse oximeters; rechargeable torches and back up systems; portable ultrasound machines and hand sanitizer in bulk.The items can be dropped off at the Nepali Cultural and Spiritual Center in Irving. Monetary donations can be made at the Nepalese Society of Texas' website As of Monday, the Nepalese Society of Texas had collected $32,000, Joshi said. An earthquake relief committee, which has representation from more than a dozen local South Asian organizations, is directly overseeing how the money is spent."We want to make sure every penny goes in the right place," Joshi said.An overwhelming number of people have also asked to join the volunteer team bound for Nepal.But, Joshi said, sending too many people at once could hamper recovery efforts. The relief committee plans to send another group of volunteers next month, when the first team is ready to return to North Texas."We have to make sure they can take care of themselves, and secondly that they can be productive when they get there," Joshi said.

3502.txt:KATHMANDU, April 29 (Reuters): The death toll from the devastating earthquake in Nepal four days ago passed 5,000 on Wednesday as officials conceded they had made mistakes in their initial response, leaving survivors stranded in remote villages waiting for aid and relief. Over 200 Nepalis protested outside parliament in the capital Kathmandu, demanding the government increase the number of buses going to the interior hills and improve distribution of aid. âI haven't been able to contact my family members in the village,â said Kayant Panday, one of the protesters, who said he woke up at 4 a.m. to get a bus to a badly hit area but was not able to get one.âThere is no way I can get information whether they are dead or alive.â The government has yet to fully assess the devastation wrought by Saturday's 7.8 magnitude quake, unable to reach many mountainous areas despite aid supplies and personnel pouring in from around the world. Anger and frustration were mounting, with many Nepalis sleeping out in the open under makeshift tents for a fourth night since the country's worst quake in more than 80 years. âThis is a disaster on an unprecedented scale. There have been some weaknesses in managing the relief operation,â Nepal's Communication Minister Minendra Rijal said late on Tuesday. âWe will improve this from Wednesday.â Prime Minister Sushil Koirala has told Reuters the death toll could reach 10,000, with information on casualties and damage from far-flung villages and towns yet to come in. That would surpass the 8,500 who died in a 1934 earthquake, the last disaster on this scale to hit the Himalayan nation of 28 million people located between India and China. Rescue helicopters have been unable to land in some remote mountainous areas. Shambhu Khatri, a technician on board one of the helicopters, said entire hillsides had collapsed in parts of the worst-hit Gorkha district, burying settlements, and access was almost impossible. A health official in Laprak, a village in the district best known as the home of Gurkha soldiers, estimated that 1,600 of the 1,700 houses in the village had been razed. An official from Nepal's home ministry said the number of confirmed deaths had risen to 5,006. Almost 10,000 were injured in Nepal, and more than 80 were also killed in India and Tibet. In Kathmandu and other cities, hospitals quickly overflowed with injured soon after the quake, with many being treated out in the open or not at all. Foreign Secretary Shanker Das Bairagi appealed for specialist doctors from overseas, as well as for search-and-rescue teams despite earlier suggestions from officials that Nepal did not need more such assistance. âOur top priority is for relief and rescue teams. We need neurologists, orthopaedic surgeons and trauma surgeons,â Bairagi said. Experts from a Polish NGO that has an 87-strong team in Nepal have said the chances of finding people alive in the ruins five days after the quake wereânext to zeroâ. Nevertheless, a Nepali-French rescue team pulled a 28-year-old man, Rishi Khanal, from a collapsed apartment block in Kathmandu on Tuesday after he had spent around 80 hours trapped in a room with three dead bodies. Doctors plan to amputate one of his legs later on Wednesday because it has been damaged by internal bleeding. âWe are trying to make contact with his parents and family members because we are going to perform a serious surgery on him,â said one of the doctors, Akhilesh Shrestha. In one of the first signs that normal life was returning, some street vendors started selling fruit in Kathmandu, but others said they were too scared to open shops because buildings had been so badly damaged. âI want to start selling, I have children at home, but how can I open a shop where it is risky for me to sit inside?â said Arjun Rai, a 54-year-old who runs a general store. Tensions between foreigners and Nepalis desperate for relief surfaced, rescuers said, as fresh avalanches were reported in several areas. Members of Israeli search-and-rescue group Magnus said hundreds of tourists, including about 100 Israelis, were being airlifted out of Langtang in Rasuwa district, a popular trekking area north of Kathmandu hit by a fresh avalanche on Tuesday. Fights had broken out there because of food shortages, Magnus team member Amit Rubin said. One of the trekkers said there had also been scuffles over places on the rescue helicopters. In other remote areas where rescue helicopters were unable to land, soldiers had started to make their way overland, first by bus, then by foot. In Sindhupalchowk, about 3-1/2 hours by road northeast of Kathmandu, the earthquake was followed by landslides, killing 1,206 people and seriously injuring close to 400. The quake also triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest that killed at least 18 climbers and guides, including four foreigners, the worst disaster on the world's highest peak.

Of this, the average annual loss from floods is 7.4 billion dollars.The Minister however added that these figures are not vetted by the government.Further in his reply, he said that damage and losses due to natural disasters are assessed by the state governments concerned, as they were primarily responsible for managing the situation after any natural disaster.

361.txt:With Internet and cellphone communications spotty, and many roads closed due to damage, the outside world did not yet have a clear picture of what is most needed following the earthquake that authorities say has killed more than 1,000 people.
361.txt:“We are treating it as a big emergency,” said Ben Pickering, Save the Children’s humanitarian adviser in Britain. “We know the damage is extensive and that access into rural areas will be very, very difficult for everybody.”
361.txt:“The full extent of the casualties and damage is still unknown but reports indicate they will likely be high, both in terms of loss of life, injuries and damage to cultural heritage,” they said.
3634.txt:While Mr Subedi’s family survived the main quake and aftershock in an area just outside Kathmandu, the damage is believed to be severe.

3640.txt:The house where the group was staying did sustain some damage in the quake, so they moved to a nearby schoolyard for temporary safety.

3668.txt:Prime Minister Sushil Koirala has told Reuters the death toll could reach 10,000, with information on casualties and damage from far-flung villages and towns yet to come in.
3668.txt:Aftershocks, severe damage from the quake, creaking infrastructure and a lack of funds have complicated rescue efforts. Food, water and power are in short supply.
3676.txt:Anil Adhikari, a police inspector at a station in the square, said that the only arrests for looting in the square were of eight teenagers who had planned to sell wood carvings at an antiques market. Outside the police station, Adhikari had collected about a dozen statues of gods and goddesses. Officials said that the issue of looting had taken on more urgency in the past several days, but each seemed to hold another agency responsible for securing the sites. But that was a subordinate worry on Tuesday in Basantapur Durbar Square, where volunteers were intent on removing the last bodies from the dusty rubble. Shortly after noon, they discovered one, a Nepalese man who was found on his chest, apparently crushed when he tried to run down the temple stairs. Thomas Bell, a journalist and the author of "Kathmandu," a 2014 book about the city, was watching the volunteers toss down carved beams, which landed atop each other in a cloud of dust. The beams, he said, should be immediately catalogued, stored and protected from further damage.
367.txt:B K Rastogi, director of the Institute of Seismological Research, has ruled out any damage in Gujarat. “The magnitude of earthquake Nepal has witnessed can cause damage to 300 km area around the epicenter. Beyond 300 km, there can be impacts of earthquake but not damage. Gujarat is far away from Nepal, and people here don’t need to worry about either today’s shock or aftershocks,” he said.
368.txt:The teams will also assess the damage, he said, adding that tomorrow also India will fly special engineering teams to help the people of Nepal.
3691.txt:Speaking to journalists in Geneva, the Spokesperson said shelter materials are among the most urgently needed relief supplies, with many people living in makeshift camps and open areas amid rain, because of damage to their homes or because they are too scared to return as aftershocks continue.
36.txt:With Internet and cellphone communications spotty, and many roads closed due to damage, the outside world did not yet have a clear picture of what is most needed following the devastating quake.
36.txt:"We know the damage is extensive and that access into rural areas will be very, very difficult for everybody," said Ben Pickering, Save the Children's humanitarian adviser in Britain.
36.txt:"The full extent of the casualties and damage is still unknown but reports indicate they will likely be high, both in terms of loss of life, injuries and damage to cultural heritage," they said.
3700.txt:“We have been to six significant destruction sites around [Kathmandu] and in the city itself. Unfortunately, we have not found survivors,” said Col. Yoram Laredo, head of the Home Front Command’s battalions and in charge of Israel’s mercy mission to Nepal.Nepali Prime Minister Sushil Koirala paid a visit to the field hospital to thank Israel for its assistance.“There are more than 200 medical nurses and other logistic staff here,” Ambassador to Nepal Yaron Mayer said.The IDF said the hospital has the capacity to treat 200 patients a day. It has an independent infrastructure and includes 50 tons of medical equipment. It has a range of wards and 125 personnel who include trained and experienced medical staff, the IDF added.For the second day in a row, Israeli rescuers continued to use helicopters rented from India and China to retrieve dozens of Israeli trekkers who were stranded in remote areas after the earthquake damaged all roads and paths leading to safety. The Nepalese army also made some of its helicopters available. But they had yet to reach dozens of other trekkers, and planned to fly out to them on Thursday. In one case, in the region of Mount Everest, the trekkers were hiking out to meet them part-way, Foreign Ministry spokesman Paul Hirschson said.Bringing them back to safety is a top priority, said Yehonathan Lebel, deputy chief of mission at the Israeli Embassy in Kathmandu.“It is very cold up there, people don’t have food and they are getting really desperate.”Israel is also searching for Or Asraf, 22, the last of its citizens still unaccounted for. He is believed to have been in the area of the Frozen Lakes in Langtang, which sustained damage. The Foreign Ministry has made contact with the other 249 Israelis who initially had been unaccounted for.A number of Israelis were able to make contact with their families via satellite phones while they waited for help.The death toll from Saturday’s quake is at least 5,000. It could reach 10,000.Bad weather and aftershocks have hampered rescue efforts, particularly in the Langtang, Mount Everest, Annapurna and Pokhara areas, where the Israeli trekkers were located.Resources have been scarce since little aid has reached those areas; in some instances, violence broke out between international trekkers, including Israelis, and the local population, which also has needed assistance.One Israeli rescuer described the situation in Langtang as “tense,” and said there had been fights between villagers and stranded trekkers over scarce food.“Villagers think the tourists are taking too much of the food,” said Amit Rubin, who is based at Kathmandu airport with a team from Magnus International Search & Rescue. Teams from the Harrel and Phoenix insurance companies also assisted in flying Israelis to safety.Trekker Lily Milkovich described the moment the quake struck.“We were sitting in our tent when suddenly a boulder of ice fell on it,” she said by telephone after being flown out to a pick-up point for bringing evacuees by bus back to Kathmandu.“After a few minutes, we found that some of our friends had been buried under the snow. Once we felt we were safe to help them, we started pulling them out,” she said.Milkovich added that there had been fights to get on the helicopters, although tensions eased when it became clear there would be sufficient flights to bring everyone to safety.US President Barack Obama spoke with Nepali Prime Minister Koirala on Wednesday about American efforts to help the nation recover from the earthquake, the White House said.Obama told Koirala the US would do all it could to help the people of Nepal, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters.The United Nations estimates that eight million people have been affected, with at least two million in need of tents, water, food and medicines over the next three months.“The timing of the intervention remains of the essence,” the UN resident and humanitarian coordinator for Nepal, Jamie McGoldrick, said in a statement. “Although I am heartened and encouraged by the progress of the response to date, efforts need to be maintained and stepped up to ensure vital assistance reaches all the affected, especially those in the remote areas.”McGoldrick’s appeal came as anger mounted over delays in delivering local aid four days after the disaster.In Kathmandu, about 200 people protested outside parliament, asking for more buses to go to their villages and hasten the distribution of aid. In Sangachowk village, about three hours by road from the capital, scores of angry villagers blocked the road with tires to stop aid trucks.Government officials admit that aid has been slow to come. Broken bridges and roads blocked by landslides have made it difficult to reach rural areas closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.Helicopters have been unable to land in some remote mountainous areas, such as the Gorkha district.It was one of the areas worst hit by the quake, with entire hillsides having collapsed, burying villages and making access almost impossible.The UN estimates that 70,000 homes were destroyed and another 530,000 damaged across 39 of Nepal’s 75 districts, forcing many to sleep out in the open or under makeshift tents in cold and damp conditions.“We’re talking about families who now don’t have so much as a tarpaulin to sleep beneath,” Mattias Bryneson, Plan International’s Nepal country director, said in a statement.“Tarpaulins and temporary shelters can save lives. If people, especially children, are exposed to bad weather all day and night, you’ll be damp, wet, dirty and freezing cold – and the spread of illness will exacerbate this humanitarian crisis.”The UN said $415 million was needed to provide 500,000 people with tents or tarpaulins, 1.4 million people with food, and 4.2 million with safe drinking water and toilets.Even before the appeal was launched, foreign countries and aid agencies had offered assistance – from search and rescue teams, sniffer dogs and equipment for heavy lifting, to blankets, dry food rations, mobile hospitals and financial aid.As of Wednesday, the UN Financial Tracking System showed that $48.25m. had been pledged by foreign governments and international aid agencies since the quake struck. Only $22.2m had been delivered.“As the monsoon season approaches, this is likely to become an added logistical challenge in providing humanitarian assistance,” the UN’s McGoldrick said.“Funding is needed immediately to continue the relief operations.”

3803.txt:(MENAFN - The Peninsula) The death toll from Nepal's devastating earthquake could reach 10,000, the prime minister said on Tuesday, as residents frustrated by the government's slow response used their bare hands to dig for signs of their loved ones."The government is doing all it can for rescue and relief on a war footing," Prime Minister Sushil Koirala told Reuters. "It is a challenge and a very difficult hour for Nepal."International aid has finally begun arriving in the Himalayan nation of 28 million people, three days after Saturday's 7.9 magnitude quake, but disbursement is slow. According to the home (interior) ministry, the confirmed death toll stands at 4,349, with more than 7,000 injured."The death toll could go up to 10,000 because information from remote villages hit by the earthquake is yet to come in," Koirala said.The United Nations said 8 million people were affected by the quake and that 1.4 million people were in need of food.Nepal's most deadly quake in 81 years also triggered a huge avalanche on Mount Everest that killed at least 17 climbers and guides, including four foreigners, the worst single disaster on the world's highest peak.All the climbers who had been stranded at camps high up on Everest had been flown by helicopters to safety, mountaineers reported on Tuesday.A series of aftershocks, severe damage from the quake, creaking infrastructure and a lack of funds have slowed rescue efforts in the impoverished, mountainous country sandwiched between India and China. In the capital Kathmandu, youths and relatives of victims were digging into the ruins of destroyed buildings and landmarks."Waiting for help is more torturous than doing this ourselves," said Pradip Subba, searching for the bodies of his brother and sister-in-law in the debris of Kathmandu's historic Dharahara tower. The 19th century minaret collapsed on Saturday as weekend sightseers clambered up its spiral stairs."Our hands are the only machine right now," said the 27-year-old, part of a group of locals pulling out bricks and blocks of concrete with cloth masks over their faces to ward off the stench of rotting bodies. "There is just no one from the government or the army to help us."Scores of people were killed in the collapse of the tower.Elsewhere in the capital's ancient Durbar Square, groups of young men cleared rubble from around an ancient temple, using pickaxes, shovels and their bare hands. A few policemen stood by, watching.Heavy rain later on Tuesday slowed down the rescue work.The head of neighboring India's National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), one of the first foreign organizations to arrive in Nepal to help in the search and rescue effort, said finding survivors and the bodies of the dead would take time.NDRF Director General O.P. Singh said heavy equipment could not fit through many of the narrow streets of Kathmandu."You have to remove all this rubble, so that will take a lot of time ... I think it's going to take weeks," he told Indian television channel NDTV late on Monday.SLEPT IN THE OPENMany people across Nepal slept in the open for a third night, their homes either flattened or threatened by tremors that spread more fear among a traumatized population.In Kathmandu, as elsewhere, thousands are sleeping on pavements, roads and in parks, many under makeshift tents.Hospitals are full to overflowing, while water, food and power are scarce, raising fears of waterborne diseases.There were some signs of normality on Tuesday, however, with fruit vendors setting up stalls on major roads and public buses back in operation.But with aid slow to reach many of the most vulnerable, some Nepalis were critical of the government."The government has not done anything for us," said Anil Giri, who was with about 20 volunteers looking for two of his friends presumed buried under rubble. "We are clearing the debris ourselves with our bare hands."Officials acknowledged they were overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster."The big challenge is relief," said Chief Secretary Leela Mani Paudel, Nepal's top bureaucrat."We urge foreign countries to give us special relief materials and medical teams. We are really desperate for more foreign expertise to pull through this crisis."The situation is worse in remote rural areas. Highways have been blocked by landslides, and many villages and communities are without water and electricity, villagers surviving on salvaged food and with no outside help.While aid has begun arriving in the capital, including food, medical supplies, tents and dogs trained for rescue efforts, the authorities are struggling to deliver relief further afield.A crush at the main international airport, where relief material and rescue teams are flying in while thousands of residents are trying to leave, has slowed the flow of aid.India and China were among the first contributors to an international effort to support Nepal's stretched resources.On Monday, the United States announced an additional $9 million in aid for Nepal, bringing total U.S. disaster funding to $10 million.U.S. and Australian military transport planes carrying search-and-rescue personnel and supplies were headed to Nepal.

3934.txt:On Kathmandu's Basantapur Durbar Square on Tuesday, a heavy wooden beam was slipping down what was left of the Maju Dega Temple.Members of a volunteer search-and-rescue team were clambering up and down the temple's base, using the beam as a stepladder and occasionally sending a shower of bricks crashing onto it. It would end up on a pile of timber, in a square traversed by people, exposed to the rain.If you worked as an antiquities dealer, you would note certain things about the beam: It was intricately carved with the image of two deities and possibly dated to the 17th century - the kind of piece that could sell for many thousands of dollars at an auction house in the West.In the three days since a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Nepal, the death toll has mounted so quickly, to more than 5,000, that most concerns other than the health and safety of its people have been put aside. Hope for finding survivors was waning, and tens of thousands of people are living in tents despite heavy rains. Reserves of clean water are running low.But in the meantime, in many places, the detritus of centuries-old temples and palaces has been left unguarded, diminishing chances to eventually rebuild one of the world's largest clusters of cultural heritage sites. Pedestrians, possibly for sentimental value, are walking away with bricks from the 19th-century Dharahara Tower, which crashed to the earth Saturday, trapping at least 40 people inside.On Monday, after a citizen called an official in Nepal's Department of Archaeology to report having thwarted an attempt to steal a bronze bell from the roof of a temple here in the capital, the authorities took some first steps to guard against looting. A notice was printed in a local newspaper Tuesday, warning that anyone taking artifacts would be punished.But there was also a sense of helplessness at the magnitude of the calamity that has befallen the Kathmandu Valley, a place meticulously documented by preservationists and named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979."Nobody is really able to do this - the government not, UNESCO not, so I think all have to work together," said Christian Manhart, the head of UNESCO's office in Kathmandu. "There are thousands of sites, and we cannot put a policeman or military on each of the sites 24 hours a day. They are needed for other purposes. So it's impossible, as you can imagine."UNESCO's top official, Irina Bokova, said in an interview Monday that she was unaware of any natural disaster in modern times that had damaged so much cultural heritage.A dull, deep sadness hung around the valley's most celebrated neighborhoods this week. Two days after the earthquake, a steep, narrow street in Bhaktapur, an ancient pink-brick city several miles from Kathmandu, had been so completely abandoned by its residents that a visitor could hear no sound except pigeons cooing.A glance up explained why: cracks zigzagged up the faces of the brick houses, tall, elegant structures with carved windows, some of which had toppled inward Saturday, crushing the people inside. Occasionally Tuesday, residents would dash in to grab bags of rice or other supplies, but their fear was still so intense that they would not stop to talk.Sitting on a curb on Yalachhen Street, in no hurry to go anywhere, was Kishor Rajbhandari, who sat gazing at the house that had belonged to his family for three generations."This is my house," he said. "It's almost gone. Outside it looks all right, but inside, there are cracks in every corner. If the next 6.5 comes, it goes out."The city of Kathmandu was built at the intersection of two trade routes linking China and India, and its architectural heritage reflects overlapping influences: miniature Buddhist votive structures from the seventh century, decorated with fine brass and wood carvings; tiered temples made of fired red bricks; monasteries, religious complexes, palaces, courtyards and clusters of tile-roofed homes.The destruction has been overwhelming. UNESCO has said temple complexes in Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan are almost destroyed. At Basantapur Durbar Square on Tuesday, teams of volunteers were shoveling debris off the foundations of two temples that had collapsed Saturday; ambulances arrived to remove two bodies the volunteers found. A few police officers stood in the square but made no attempt to supervise the effort."There is no organization whatsoever," said Kaitlin Bull, 22, a tourist from Canada who spent four hours helping clear rubble off Maju Dega. "It's just a free-for-all."In the hurry to remove the rubble, carved beams and struts had ended up in piles of scrap wood, although a few particularly beautiful carvings - like one pink-stained piece showing women frolicking acrobatically below two smiling gods - had been set aside.Anil Adhikari, a police inspector at a station in the square, said that the only arrests for looting in the square were of eight teenagers who had planned to sell wood carvings at an antiques market. Outside the police station, Adhikari had collected about a dozen statues of gods and goddesses.Officials said that the issue of looting had taken on more urgency in the past several days, but each seemed to hold another agency responsible for securing the sites.Adhikari said his police station had informed officials from the government's Archaeology Department of the treasures in the rubble, but the department's officials had not come.Chandra Mani Adhikari, a member of the government's national planning commission, said he had instructed the department to "take action to preserve all these things quickly."The director general of the Archaeology Department, Bhesh Narayan Dahal, for his part, said he had visited the city's police and district officer and "requested him to please provide more and more security in that area."He had also given orders for the warning against looting to be printed and broadcast and told staff members to visit heritage sites and lock up artifacts in a museum for safekeeping."I am too much worried," he said. "How can I tell you? I am too much worried. How will we save our heritage?"But that was a subordinate worry on Tuesday in Basantapur Durbar Square, where volunteers were intent on removing the last bodies from the dusty rubble. Shortly after noon, they discovered one, a Nepalese man who was found on his chest, apparently crushed when he tried to run down the temple stairs.Thomas Bell, a journalist and the author of "Kathmandu," a 2014 book about the city, was watching the volunteers toss down carved beams, which landed atop each other in a cloud of dust. The beams, he said, should be immediately cataloged, stored and protected from further damage.In Nepal, "people don't necessarily place a great deal of value on a piece of wood just because it's old," he said. "But if you were to restore the temple, you would want it back."

Archaeologists have found evidence of worshippers at this site as early as 1000 B.C., perhaps members of a pre-Buddhist tree-worshipping sect. The extent of the damage at Lumbini is not yet known because of the difficulty of getting in and out of the area.

4197.txt:The devastating earthquake which hit Nepal on Saturday seems to have set off a process of unscientific inquiry among some associates of the Sangh Parivar. Most of their speculation has focussed on the causal factors which led to this violent displacement of the earth’s crust.Vishwa Hindu Parishad functionary Sadhvi Prachi linked the earthquake to Rahul Gandhi visiting Kathmandu. Lest you dismiss her views out of hand, she backed this up with another data point: as it turns out, Rahul had also visited Uttarakhand before this and soon that state saw massive flooding.Bharatiya Janata Party Member of Parliament Sakshi Maharaj extended this line of thought: Rahul Gandhi had caused this calamity because he ate beef and then went to Kedarnath last week, without any sort of purification ceremony. Without such basic precautionary measures in place “the earthquake was bound to happen,” said Maharaj.Sandeep Balakrishna, chief editor of a right wing website called India Facts, changed tack: ignoring Rahul, he went in for the always dependable religious-minorities-are-responsible angle. “Call me superstitious,” he tweeted, cleverly anticipating his critics, “but the Nepal earthquake happened because the missionaries are trying to destroy dharma”.Naturally, this sort of talk led to outrage. The factors which cause earthquakes have been known to science for hundreds of years now and none of them involve the Gandhis, steaks or the Lord’s Prayer. However, the outragers should know that the people linking human actions and earthquakes have an illustrious predecessor, who did the same thing, eight decades back: the Father of the Nation, Mohandas Gandhi.In 1934, Nepal and Bihar were hit by a devastating earthquake. Unlike 2015, Bihar was also severely affected, with even Patna facing widespread damage. In response to this, Gandhi, in a statement to the press, said that he believed that this natural disaster was “a divine chastisement for the great sin we have committed against those whom we describe as Harijans”.God had punished Biharis, Gandhi said, because they practised untouchability against Dalits.This irrational correlation set off a public debate between Gandhi and the man who had given him the title of “Mahatma", Rabindranath Tagore.Tagore shot off a rebuttal on rationalist lines, with a request for it to be published in Gandhi’s journal, Harijan. The letter expressed “painful surprise” at “this kind of unscientific view of things”. It was simply inaccurate, Gurudeb argued, to “associate ethical principles with cosmic phenomena”.Thanking Gandhi for inducing a “a freedom from fear and feebleness in the minds of his countrymen”, Tagore nevertheless felt “profoundly hurt” when Gandhi’s words strengthened the “elements of unreason” which was the “fundamental source of all the blind powers that drive us against freedom and self-respect”.Gandhi published this letter but stuck to his guns. Expressing “profound regard” for the “Bard of Santiniketan”, the Mahatma wrote:Tagore did not reply to this and the debate ended here. The correspondence between these great figures of pre-independence India is extensive and very interesting, and the two would also clash on the idea of nationalism, on which, again, Tagore’s rationalist philosophy went up against Gandhi’s more emotional views.Gandhi is, today, a symbol for India’s left wingers and liberals. India’s present-day conservatives do not like Gandhi all that much. Even though Sandeep Balakrishna and the Mahatma might share common ground over the role human religion has to play in causing an earthquake, Balakrishna’s website, India Facts has multiple articles shrilly critical of Gandhi with what are now standard right wing arguments: Gandhi attacked Hindu sentiments, disliked Hindu nationalists, denied political empowerment to Hindus and so on.This episode, though, gives us an interesting look at a Gandhi that almost everyone has forgotten today: Gandhi, the conservative.Gandhi, says writer Mukul Kesavan, had a “willingness to deploy a 'Hindu' idiom in political discourse”. This is what he did for the earthquake, of course. To fight the social evil of untouchability, Gandhi bought in the idiom of theology. It wasn’t enough to educate people about it; Gandhi also said God himself was displeased with this practice, hence he killed twenty thousand people. Gandhi was, maybe, self-aware of his irrationality, but used this argument nonetheless given the potential good it could do. Gandhi wrote: “If my belief [of connecting the earthquake and untouchability] turns out ill-founded, it will still have done good to me and those who believe with me”.This belief, that using the religious idiom was the best way to reach out to people, was the bedrock of Gandhi’s politics. In Young India, 1925, Gandhi had this to say:The bland literal translation of the word “Mahatma” in English as “great soul” does not really capture the force of the word as it’s used in Hindi. This use of a religious idiom by Gandhi meant that across many parts of India, he came to be seen as a true mahatma, a religious guru with occult powers. Historian Shahid Amin has culled some instances of these beliefs from the local Hindi press of Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh during the Non-Cooperation Movement (1921-’22):1. Sikandar Sahu said that he would believe in the Mahatmaji when the karah (boiling pan) full of cane-juice in his karkhana split into two. The karah split in two in the middle.2. A pandit of Rampur village was repeatedly told by many to give up his habit of eating fish, but he did not listen to anybody. He said: “I shall eat fish, let's see what the Mahatmaji can do”. When he sat down to eat the fish, it was crawling with worms.3. Pt Damodar Pandey, from district Basti, reported that a man in Dumariya near his village had called Gandhi names, as a result of which his eyelids had got stuck.4. In Rustampur, a purse of a man containing Rs 90 had disappeared from his hut. When he took manauti (prayer) of Mahatmaji, he found it back in his hut, and the money was intact.The use of the religious idiom, of presenting himself as a mahatma, meant that Gandhi could reach out to the many millions who would remain untouched if his message had been delivered using blander political language. In Gorakhpur, for example, a very many number of people came out against the Raj, not for any explicit political reasons, but because they simply believed that a mahatma had told them to do so and it was their religious duty.Of course, Gandhi was no mindless Twitter troll. He knew what he was doing and, in what is often a complex idea to digest given our binaries today, his irrationality and use of religion wasn’t driven by narrow mindedness. He reached out to Muslims too, using a community-specific religious idiom: the preservation of the Muslim Caliph after World War I.Gandhi was a great soul but, more than that, he was a great mind. He used these religious idioms for causes that many would today recognise as rational and “good”: Hindu-Muslim unity, fighting untouchability and anti-colonialism.But, of course, as Gandhi himself postulated many times, the ends rarely justify the means. Once these religious idioms had been placed out there and popularised, there were open to be used by people with souls not nearly as great as Gandhi’s. The earthquake is a minor example, but two of the Mahatma's biggest religio-political symbols, Ram and cow protection, have been used to the hilt by religious conservatives in Independent India, for ends that many would consider distinctly unGandhian.

4224.txt:KATHMANDU  The earthquake that ravaged Nepal on Saturday has robbed Kathmandu valley of not only thousands of human lives, but also a part of its cultural heritage, damaging practically all the UNESCO world heritage sites, some of which were in the countrys capital.Some of the ruined temples and historic monuments in Kathmandus iconic Bashantpur Durbar reflect the impact of the earthquake on Nepals historic and cultural heritage.This place was amazing, a UNESCO heritage site, but the devastation turned it into a desert. Probably it is not going to attract people here anymore, World Hindu youth Federation president Rajan Maharajan told Efe.Some of the temples have been reduced to dust and rubble, while many onlookers are stunned to see their heritage on the ground in pieces, while people seem to cope by taking photos with their mobile phones of the imprint left by the disaster on their cultural heritage.Maharajan, who was in charge of looking after the monuments, with a pained face pointed out that one of the buildings destroyed in the Durbar was the replica of the Pashupatinath Temple, Nepals holiest Hindu shrine located on the outskirts of Kathmandu.Only the royalty could enter this temple, he recalled nostalgically.He further said that very few buildings had survived the earthquake for now, but one does not know what will happen later, as buildings thought to be structurally unsound may be demolished for security reasons.The oldest of them went back 500 years.Gajendra Shrestha of the Conscientious Citizens organization blamed the countrys government for fate of the monuments, claiming that it had neglected the monuments, which, in his opinion, were not in the best conditions to withstand an earthquake.Though old constructions have been the most affected, the quake also demolished several new ones in Kathmandu.The Durbar areas turned into a cemetery, full of dead bodies and bricks.Several bodies were found in the Krishna Temple, another dozen in Maju Dengan and a five-story building that collapsed in the region, according to the calculations of the Hindu federation president.During the quake, many people were donating blood in the area, many of whom have died, he added with a somber face.Situated in the heart of the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu Durbar is not the only site to have been severely affected.According to UNESCO, considerable damage has been recorded in Patan Durbar, the palaces of Hanuman Dhoka in Kathmandu, and the Bhaktapur monument complex, which has been practically destroyed.The landmark Dharahara tower, built in 1832, also came crumbling down, and 120 bodies were found in its debris.Moreover, Sagarmantha National Park, another UNESCO natural heritage site at the base of Mt. Everest falls, was also seriously affected.Besides the human losses -more than 5,000 people dead and 11,000 injured so far-damage to cultural heritage also signifies huge economic losses in the form of tourism revenue.According to Maharajan, the Bashantpur complex alone, visited by thousands of tourists every day, supplied income equivalent to around $495,000 per year.There are temples, there is God. But I cannot see them, he exclaimed while touring the ruins sites, temples where he will no longer be able to worship.

4237.txt:The initial quake was centered a bit to the west of Mhanegang near Barpak, but according to geologists, the shallow nature of this quake meant that its greatest devastation rippled out to the east – right toward Mhanegang. And, of course, hundreds of other villages. Estimates are that 90 percent of the houses in Rasuwa district were destroyed. U.S. Fulbright Scholar Austin Lord gives a vivid account of how terrifying it was to be in Langtang during the earthquake. Yale anthropologist Sara Shneiderman, Ph.D. ’09, and anthropologist Mark Turin report extensive damage in Dolakha. Roshan Phyuba Tamang visited his home village of Darkka in Dhading and posted photos of the damage, which are still among the only pictures available from the region between the epicenter and Kathmandu.
423.txt:A powerful earthquake struck Nepal and sent tremors through northern India on April 25, killing hundreds of people, toppling an historic 19th-century tower in the capital Kathmandu and touching off a deadly avalanche on Mount Everest.There were reports of devastation in outlying, isolated mountainous areas after the quake struck with a magnitude of 7.9, the worst in 81 years, with its epicenter 80 kilometers east of Nepal's second largest city, Pokhara.A collapse in communications hampered relief efforts, raising fears of a humanitarian disaster across the impoverished Himalayan nation of 28 million people.A home ministry official told Reuters said the death toll had reached 758 in Nepal. A further 34 fatalities were reported in northern India and one in Bangladesh. The quake was shallow in depth, intensifying its destructive force.Indian tourist Devyani Pant was in a Kathmandu coffee shop with friends when "suddenly the tables started trembling and paintings on the wall fell on the ground."I screamed and rushed outside," she told Reuters by telephone from the capital, where at least 181 people died."We are now collecting bodies and rushing the injured to the ambulance. We are being forced to pile several bodies one above the other to fit them in."A tourism official said at least 17 people were killed when an avalanche unleashed by the earthquake swept through the Everest Base Camp for climbers of the world's highest mountain.Choti Sherpa, who works at the Everest Summiteers Association, was unable to call her family and colleagues on the mountain. "Everyone is trying to contact each other, but we can't," she said. "We are all very worried."Around 300,000 foreign tourists were estimated to be in Nepal for the spring trekking and climbing season, and officials were overwhelmed by calls from concerned friends and relatives."We are facing a tremendous crisis here and it is hard to even assess what the death toll and the extent of damage could be," said Mohan Krishna Sapkota, a second tourism official."The trekkers are scattered all around the base camp and some had even trekked further up. It is almost impossible to get in touch with anyone."A landlocked nation sandwiched between India and China, popular with adventure tourists, Nepal has had its share of natural disasters. Its worst earthquake in 1934 killed more than 8,500 people.Political instability weakens the ability of the government to handle a crisis - Nepal has still not upgraded its weather forecasting despite being surprised by unseasonal blizzards last autumn that killed 32 in the Annapurna massif.In 2001, Nepal burst into global headlines when then-Crown Prince Dipendra gunned down 10 members of his family, including his father, King Birendra Shah, before killing himself.The revered Dharara Tower collapsed in Kathmandu when the quake erupted shortly before noon local time. A policeman said that up to 200 people had been trapped in the structure.Built in 1832 for the queen of Nepal, the tower was a 60-meter-high landmark that had been open to visitors for the last 10 years and had a viewing balcony.A jagged stump just 10 meters high was all that was left of the lighthouse-like structure. Several bodies were extracted from the ruins.At the main hospital in Kathmandu, people with broken limbs and arms were being rushed in for treatment. Crowds and volunteers formed human chains to clear the way for ambulances to bring in the injured.Kathmandu is home to ancient, wooden Hindu temples. Photographs posted online showed buildings reduced to rubble, with large cracks along roads and residents sitting in the street holding babies."I can see three bodies of monks trapped in a debris of a collapsed building near a monastery," said Pant, the Indian tourist. "We are trying to pull the bodies out and look for anyone who is trapped."The Everest avalanches, first reported by climbers, raised fears for those on the world's loftiest peak a year after a massive snow slide caused the deadliest incident yet there.The first rescue plane carrying people injured in an avalanche at the Everest base camp arrived in Kathmandu on April 26 carrying 15 climbers who survived the collapse triggered by Nepal's worst earthquake in 81 years.Romanian climber Alex Gavan said on Twitter that there had been a "huge avalanche" and "many, many" people were up on the mountain. "Running for life from my tent," Gavan said. "Everest base camp huge earthquake then huge avalanche."Another climber, Daniel Mazur, said Everest base camp had been "severely damaged" and his team was trapped."Please pray for everyone," he said on his Twitter page.An avalanche in April 2014 just above the base camp on Mount Everest killed 16 Nepali guides.The tremors on April 25 were felt as far away as New Delhi and other northern cities in India, with reports that they had lasted up to a minute.The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake, initially measured at 7.7 but upgraded to 7.9 magnitude, struck 80 kilometers east of Pokhara. It was only 2 kilometers deep.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired an emergency meeting and dispatched a military air transporter with three tons of supplies and a 40-member disaster response team to Nepal. Three more planes were to follow later on Saturday, carrying a mobile hospital and further relief teams.

4242.txt:Little faith in government Chhunjing Sherpa Chhunjing Sherpa teaches middle school in Khumjung. He says he is lucky that the earthquake struck on a Saturday. No one was at the school, including his two kids, 12 and 13. But like most everyone else in this area, his house is badly damaged and he needs money to repair it. He is hoping a charitable organization will issue a grant or maybe a bank will give him a discounted earthquake loan. He listens to a government official, who has traveled from Kathmandu to Khumjung to assess the damage for himself. But Sherpa has little faith in the government. "We have no government, no NGOs, no tents, no TV, nothing," he says. "How are we to go on with life as before?" CNN's Moni Basu
4242.txt:Pretending to be a doctor Ramprasad Nepal Ramprasad Nepal, 32, was on the roof of his house in Nuwakot, north of Kathmandu, when the quake struck. The entire house shook violently and he could see other structures around him starting to crumble. He thought he would die if he stayed put, so he jumped about 30 feet to the ground. In doing so, he broke his right leg. He managed to take himself to the local hospital, but it had also sustained damage, he says. Instead, he bought painkillers and gauze at a pharmacy and pretended to be a doctor. That was how it was for two days when he finally found a bus that agreed to carry him to Kathmandu. The normal fare is 140 Nepalese rupees; he paid 700. The doctors, he says, told him they needed to operate on his leg. But in the overwhelmed Tribhuvan Teaching Hospital, it hasn't happened yet. Friday evening at 6, Ramprasad Nepal was hungry. He had not been allowed to eat because of pending surgery. "It's been six days now. I'm frustrated," he says. "The doctors, I wish they would give me a straight answer." CNN's Moni Basu

The seven-story building in Kathmandu was home to a congregation of about four dozen people, and Tamang's father was their pastor. He is buried somewhere under the rubble. Six bodies had already been pulled from the concrete and steel wreckage when Tamang's father is found alive. He is rushed away for treatment. "It's sad," says Tamang, surveying the damage. "It's hard." CNN's Arwa Damon, Gul Tuysuz, Euan McKirdy and Steve Goldberg
4242.txt:The pressure is off Selena Dohal An ambulance arrives at Kathmandu's Bir Hospital. An 8-year-old girl with a blackened eye and bloody bandages around her head is rushed inside in a wheelchair. Selena Dohal was at home when the earthquake hit, fracturing her skull. "She went to get some water and a house collapsed on her head," her grandfather, Ram Prasad Duhal, said. She spent hours in the rubble before being rescued. She needs the skills of the surgeons at Bir if she's to survive. Duhal accompanied his granddaughter to Bir from Panchhkal, about 30 miles to the east. The journey took more than a day. Selena is dazed and clearly in pain, but an examination of her CT scan reveals how dire her situation is. Her brain is swelling. Without immediate surgery, she'll have permanent damage -- or die. "She was badly crushed," says neurosurgeon Bikesh Khambu. "The roof of the house was on her." Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent and a practicing neurosurgeon, is reporting from Bir and is asked to assist in Selena's operation. Working in conditions like those found in war zones, the surgeons remove bone from Selena's skull to relieve the swelling. The operation is a success, and her prognosis is good. It might not look it, Gupta says, but Selena is one of the lucky ones. CNN's Tim Hume and Steve Goldberg
4242.txt:Safe kids, scattered dreams Pushpa Basnet The parents are in prison. Now the children are sleeping on the ground, inside a greenhouse. Pushpa Basnet provides a home and education for 45 kids whose parents are incarcerated. But the quake cracked the walls at her Early Childhood Development Center, and the staff fears it might fall down. She and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse, taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves. "It's really cold in the middle of the night; there are lots of fox in the field," Basnet said. "We are really scared." They also don't have much water or food. But Basnet says she is trying to stay positive. "I think for the time being, whatever we have, we should be happy, you know? Because at least we have our life," she said. "(My kids) all are safe. That's the most important thing for me." Basnet's "Butterfly Home" -- the permanent residence she was building for the children -- also suffered extensive damage. Basnet had hoped to have it open by October. She had purchased the land for the home with prize money she received as CNN's 2012 Hero of the Year. "When the earthquake hit that land, all my dreams were scattered," she said. "I have to restart again." CNN's Sumnima Udas, Kathleen Toner and Christie O'Reilly

Soroptimist International of Truckee Meadows, a local group that supports women and children locally and throughout the world, has been partnering with the village of Thulipakori, Nepal for over 15 years. The village has sustained substantial damage as a result of the earthquake. SITM has established an emergency relief fund that will assist the village in taking care of its immediate needs for food and shelter and later in helping to rebuild. To donate go to http://sitmnv.org/ , which will take you to the donation site at the Community Foundation of Western Nevada.
4254.txt:SITM's project will include grants to pay for immediate needs of individual families because of the earthquake damage. In one district in the village, every occupied home was destroyed. Short term aid will include, among other things, items such as tents, blankets, food, water, and clothes. Long term aid will include more permanent programs such as assistance with rebuilding their homes and replanting their crops and securing more livestock. Because the local Soroptimist Club has personal contact with the school counsel and the village elders and is an all-volunteer non-profit organization, all of the aid donations will go to help the people of the region without reduction for administrative costs. The donations are tax deductible. For more information, contact SITM President Pam Sutton at pam@crystalwindglass.com or 775-830-8388.

4329.txt:AS the world woke up on Sunday to horrific images of death and destruction in Nepal, Kiran Joshi sat in a hotel room in Beijing feeling sick to his stomach. Joshi had just been in Kathmandu 12 hours earlier. Now he watched his hometown burn on the TV news.But there was another reason Joshi was so sickened by the scenes from Kathmandu. He had seen them all before — in his own movie."We thought we were exaggerating the damage when we made our documentary, but now I watch the news and the devastation is even worse," Joshi told The Washington Post on Monday. "It's chilling."Joshi is a Hollywood insider turned Nepalese innovator. He helped create classics including "Beauty and the Beast" and "The Lion King" during an 18-year career with Walt Disney, but left in 2008 to found Nepal's first special effects and animation studio.Now, however, he has the disturbing distinction of having foreshadowed his own hometown's collapse on film.Joshi was born in Kathmandu: a computer nerd who struggled to get the latest equipment in Nepal. He left the country when he was 19 to study in the U.S. and then joined Disney, where he helped program complex animations sequences in "Aladdin," "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" and "Atlantis."But even though he married and had a kid in the United States, Joshi felt pulled back to Nepal."The year 2007 was the turning point in his life," according to a 2010 profile. "When he had come to Nepal for the funeral of a relative, his friend Sanjeev Rajbhandari suggested opening a studio in Nepal. He then spent three weeks in small animation boutiques and was impressed to see the portfolios of skilled and passionate young artists. He met a 19-year-old boy who showed his portfolio and said that his passion was animation but due to pressure from his parents, he had been studying management. He asked Kiran for help, so realizing the level of this boy's passion, he decided it was time to open an animation studio in Nepal."In 2008, he founded Incessant Rain Animation Studios, the first of its kind in Kathmandu. Initially, the company focused on animating films for Hollywood.But in 2010, when a 7.0 magnitude earthquake leveled Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Joshi realized there was important work to be done about Nepal, which sits on a seismic fault line.The United Nations, Red Cross and other development agencies poured money and resources into Nepal in order to raise awareness about disaster preparation and rescue procedures. But Joshi didn't think the message was reaching everyone."There was a lot of preparation done in terms of educating people at a higher level," he said, "but due to circumstances in Nepal, which is very poor, it hasn't reached everybody."So Joshi teamed with the Red Cross and the American embassy to produce a series of animated public service announcements. In the videos, a heroic red panda — a local animal — teaches people how to prepare for an earthquake as well as what to do during and after a disaster."The red panda is like our version of Smokey the Bear," Joshi explained. "We're trying to teach people about safety."In January, Joshi debuted a different project: a documentary called "Moving Mountains." The film featured interviews with the few remaining survivors from Nepal's last devastating earthquake, an 8.2 magnitude tremor on Jan. 15, 1934. More than 10,000 people died in Nepal — mostly in Kathmandu — with nearly as many perishing across the border in Bihar, India.But Joshi wanted to do more than remind the Nepalese of the previous earthquake. He wanted to stir them to take action to prevent another disaster. ("Their past could become our future" is the movie's tagline.) So he enlisted his animators in creating dramatic scenes of the potential ruin another powerful earthquake could cause modern-day Kathmandu."Basically, through animation we destroyed many of Kathmandu's most famous monuments, including the Dharahara Tower, our number one monument," he said. "In our documentary we leveled that off. We were trying to say, 'This is how bad the devastation could be.' "Joshi said he and his team debated long and hard about just how graphic to make the scenes in the movie."That was the biggest thing we discussed: to what level do we portray those visuals?" he said. "On one level you don't want people to panic, but on another level you want to wake them up. If you show just a few houses getting knocked down, people won't care unless it is their house. But if you are showing some significant landmarks of the country, it will send a very strong message."Joshi's digitally animated film didn't prepare him for the destruction that Kathmandu suffered on Sunday, however."That was the most devastating part," he said. "When I saw the news and I saw that the tower was completely knocked off."From his hotel room in Beijing, Joshi eventually contacted several of his co-workers in Kathmandu. None of his employees was seriously injured in the earthquake, but large cracks appeared in the office walls."We were very lucky," he said. "One artist comes from the epicenter area. He said his whole village is pretty much leveled off."As of early Monday morning, the death toll stood at roughly 3,800. But Joshi said there are other costs."It's very sad," Joshi added. "I think Nepal and Kathmandu will never be what they were before. Besides losing so many lives, lots of our culture is in our buildings and monuments. They are completely damaged. What I love about Nepal is its rich culture. Everyone of those temples and monuments has a history why they were built. I know they will build back the city, but some of the charm about these old, antique buildings will be gone."From 1996 until 2006, Nepal was gripped by conflicts between government forces and Maoist insurgents. Since then, political squabbling has often shut down the government and stymied progress, Joshi said. He hoped the solidarity he had seen since the earthquake would push the poor, Himalayan country past such problems."The political structure is really messed up, he said. "The parties are always fighting and trying to create ethnic divides, but dividing the country along ethnic lines is not good for the country."Now we are coming together and rebuilding our lives after the earthquake," Joshi said. "I hope politicians realize the value of being one nation. I hope that something good comes out of this tragedy and Nepal rebuilds itself, not just from an infrastructure standpoint but also pulling itself together as a people."Joshi said he couldn't be sure that his public service announcements or even his apocalyptic movie helped save anyone's life in Nepal. But he felt that his movies might be able to play a role in rebuilding Kathmandu by reminding people of what has been lost."The good thing about animation is that whatever you have in your mind you can create," he said. "So many world heritage sites have been destroyed. I hope we can recreate them 3-dimensionally."If we reconstruct those temples on film," he said, "maybe that can be a way of getting the stakeholders to realize what could be in the future."

4341.txt:SINDHUPALCHOWK: Homeless, exhausted and angry, Nepal quake survivors on Thursday began attacking relief convoys as complaints of tardy aid distribution piled up despite a glut of relief material clogging the airport and relief hubs.Wet and chilly weather hampered relief work as residents remained on edge due to aftershocks that have rattled the country since the Saturday quake that has destroyed thousands of buildings. The official death toll so far is 5,800 but Nepal Army chief General Gaurav Rana, who is leading the nationwide rescue effort, told NBC News, "Our estimates are not looking good. We are thinking that 10,000 to 15,000 may be killed."Most fatalities have been reported from Sindhupalchowk, a district separated from Kathmandu by about 70km but by decades in time. By Thursday, 1,600 people had lost their lives, according to the district administrative office. Many more were yet to be pulled out from the rubble of flattened homes.Little in terms of aid had reached here though. The local media said this has increasingly led to attacks on relief vehicles.Angry men, some of them kids, captured three containers of tents and other items that were being ferried by the Nepal Army at Sangachowk. They said they were afraid what was meant for them might go to "people with connections".These were perhaps the first trucks that had arrived in the district with the most damage to both life and property -- by comparison the Kathmandu toll stood at about 1,100 on Thursday -- and people were not ready to lose them.Som Bahadur Tamang said he was one of those who tried to seize the contents of the vehicle that were sent by Save the Children and escorted by army men."We are hardworking, honest men," he said. "We are not robbers. But look at how we have been living. It has been almost a week after the earthquake and we are still out in the open. The children have been crying all day. They are cold and without milk. Ke garne ra, paristithi nai esto chha (What can we do, the situation called for it)."The 100-odd tents, even if they found their way to the needy, are nothing compared to what the 1,50,000 affected in Sindhupalchowk want.They are mostly out on their own. Local residents spoke of how in the absence of basic first aid, seven people, who had been dug out alive in Golchhe after hours of effort, died later for want of treatment.Elsewhere in Dolakha district, victims of the quake targeted government buildings and burnt furniture. In Gorkha, Nuwakot, Ramechhap and Dhading, some of the most severely-hit districts, rage was growing.Away from Kathmandu, officials are both anxious and resigned. Sindhupalchowk district officer Krishna Gyawali said, "So many people come demanding relief, but what can we do if nothing has reached us? How can we make them understand?"Nepal will have to get its act together and quickly take aid to the people, a concern that its National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has now raised.NHRC in its latest report said "real earthquake victims" have not received help, both in Kathmandu Valley and elsewhere. In a statement, it said that food and other material that has come from foreign countries lay in piles at the Tribhuvan International Airport and that the need of the hour was to disburse it at the earliest.Back in Sindhupalchowk, some of the bodies that remain trapped in buildings, 90% of which have been damaged, have begun to rot. There is a deep sense of helplessness all around."We can do nothing," wept Mira Karki, who lost her husband and mother-in-law. "We will die of starvation and disease or cold if the government does not act soon. Please tell them."In Kathmandu, overnight rainfall forced many people to return to their damaged homes leading to thinning out of tent cities. Many small shops too began to open.

4425.txt:Nepal Grants Operating Permission, Call Signs to Visiting Hams, as Earthquake Recovery Continues: In the wake of the devastating April 25 earthquake, hams in Nepal, already in limited supply, have been turning out to help in the ongoing recovery. The Nepalese government also is reported to be cutting some of the red tape that has prevented hams from outside the country from operating within Nepal. Several hams from India are among those who have arrived in Nepal to help facilitate communication. Word earlier this week via Amateur Radio Society of India President Gopal Madhavan, VU2GMN, was that visiting hams would not be permitted to operate in Nepal, unless they were part of a government team. On the other hand, getting needed Amateur Radio equipment into Nepal remains problematic. "ARRL is working closely with amateurs in Nepal to identify equipment needed for the relief effort," said ARRL Emergency Preparedness Manager Mike Corey, KI1U. "We are preparing a shipment from the Ham Aid http://www.arrl.org/ham-aid inventory, but like other NGOs, we are facing transportation challenges. We hope to have transportation arrangements in place soon." Unconfirmed reports said another group was having problems getting a repeater into Nepal. While parts of the telecommunication infrastructure remain in operation, power is out. Ham radio remains a reliable link at this stage of the recovery effort. A major focus of rescue teams has been attempting to locate the missing, as well as to recover quake victims buried beneath debris. More than 5000 people are now reported dead as a result of the earthquake and subsequent aftershocks. The disaster also has stranded many people, as roads were cut off by landslides and damage. Rain, heavy at times, has hampered rescue and recovery work. "In spite of the conditions, ham radio operation is in progress, and the Nepal government has started issuing licenses to visiting hams, with 9N7 prefixes," said Jayu Bhide, VU2JAU. Bhide, who is the Amateur Radio Society of India's National Coordinator for Disaster Communication, said these stations have been asked to help provide communication to more of the devastated region. Ham radio groups are being asked to spread out in terms of operating frequencies as well. Bhide said a lot of the Amateur Radio traffic has consisted of health-and-welfare inquiries. Mike Kalter, W8CI, told ARRL that he relayed an urgent request from the family of a woman traveling between Nepal and Tibet with a tour group. He passed along the information via ham radio to Mohan Suri, VU2MYH, in Nepal, who supplied the information to authorities. Within a few days, the woman being sought reported back through Jerry Long, KJ4YAP, that groups were going through the streets of Kathmandu, announcing names of individuals being sought, and she heard her name called out. The woman and her tour group were subsequently helicoptered out of Nepal. At least two groups of hams from Gujarat, India, were planning to travel to Nepal and set up stations "at critical places," Bhide said, adding that he, Ananda Majumdar, VU2AGJ, and Sandip Baruah, VU2MUE, were planning to set up HF and VHF stations at Gorakhpur, on the India-Nepal border. Amateur Radio HF nets have been one link between Nepal and the outside world, as Internet service continues to be spotty. Nepalese hams also are active locally on VHF/UHF. Bhide said residents in the affected areas were finding it difficult to contact family members, as their cell phones have discharged, and no charging facility is available. He and some of the radio amateurs active on the relief and recovery nets contacted agencies in Nepal to provide small solar charging units.

Short term aid will include, among other things, items such as tents, blankets, food, water, and clothes. Long term aid will include more permanent programs such as assistance with rebuilding their homes and replanting their crops and securing more livestock. Because the local Soroptimist Club has personal contact with the school counsel and the village elders and is an all-volunteer non-profit organization, all of the aid donations will go to help the people of the region without reduction for administrative costs. The donations are tax deductible. For more information, contact SITM President Pam Sutton at pam@crystalwindglass.com or 775-830-8388.
446.txt:While the extent of the damage and the scale of the disaster were yet to be known, the quake will put a huge strain on the resources of the poor country best known for Everest, the highest mountain in the world, and its rich Hindu culture. The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, relies heavily on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain climbing. A mountaineering guide, Ang Tshering, said an avalanche swept the face of Mt Everest after the earthquake, and government officials said at least 10 climbers were killed and 30 injured. Their nationalities were not immediately known. Carsten Lillelund Pedersen, a Dane who is climbing Everest with a Belgian, Jelle Veyt, said on his Facebook page that they were at Khumbu Icefall , a rugged area of collapsed ice and snow close to base camp at altitude 5,000 metres (16,500 feet), when the earthquake hit.
446.txt:The US Geological Survey put the magnitude of the quake at 7.8. It said the quake hit at 11:56 am local time at Lamjung, about 80 kilometres (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu. Its depth was only 11 kilometeres (seven miles). The shallower the quake the more destructive power it carries. A magnitude 7 quake is capable of widespread and heavy damage while an 8 magnitude quake can cause tremendous damage. This means Saturday's quake - with the same magnitude as the one that hit San Francisco in 1906 - was about 16 times more powerful than the 7.0 quake that devastated Haiti in 2010.

(AP Photo/ Niranjan Shrestha) Powerful earthquake strikes Nepal: Things to Know GREGORY KATZ, Associated Press A powerful earthquake struck the Nepal region on Saturday, causing widespread casualties and triggering an avalanche on Mount Everest. The key information known at this time: ___ HOW BAD IS THE DAMAGE? It's too early to tell, but early indications suggest the early figure of 926 people killed in four countries is likely to rise substantially in the coming days. The magnitude-7.8 quake was the worst to hit Nepal in eight decades and caused damage and fatalities in neighboring countries as well. In addition to the hundreds of deaths in Nepal, at least 34 people were killed in India, 12 in Tibet and two in Bangladesh. Two Chinese citizens died at the Nepal-China border. The earthquake hit a heavily populated area of Nepal, including the capital, Kathmandu, and its impact spread far beyond the Kathmandu Valley. Strong aftershocks were felt an hour after the initial temblor. Earthquake experts are preparing for high numbers in terms of deaths and damage. "This is a very large earthquake in a significantly populated region with infrastructure that has been damaged in past earthquakes," U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Paul Earle said. "Significant fatalities are expected." Local hospitals were already filling with injured residents, and Kathmandu's international airport was shut down, hampering initial relief efforts in the isolated mountainous country. An injured man receives treatment outside the Medicare Hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal, Saturday, April 25, 2015. A strong magnitude-7.9 earthquake shook Nepal's capital and the densely populated Kathmandu Valley before noon Saturday, causing extensive damage with toppled walls and collapsed buildings, officials said. (AP Photo/ Niranjan Shrestha) ___ WHAT HAPPENED? AND WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? Seismologist Earle said the quake happened on what is known as a "thrust fault." That describes the situation when one piece of the Earth's crust is moving beneath another piece. In this case, it's the Indian plate that is moving north at 45 millimeters (1.7 inches) a year under the Eurasian plate to the north, Earle said. It's a different type of earthquake than the one that caused the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. "This is what builds the Himalayan mountain range," Earle said. The region and particular fault has a history of damaging earthquakes, including four temblors with magnitudes greater than 6.0 in the past 100 years, Earle said, warning that landslides are a particular worry now, given the steep slopes in the region. ___ WHAT DOES 'RED ALERT' ISSUED BY U.S. OFFICIALS MEAN? The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake was strong enough to merit a "red alert" for shaking-related fatalities and economic losses. It said that "high casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread. Past red alerts have required a national or international response." Quick USGS calculations estimate a two-thirds likelihood of between 1,000 and 100,000 fatalities and damage between $100 million and $10 billion. Scientists estimate that more than 105 million people felt at least moderate shaking during the quake. ___ WHAT HAPPENED ON MOUNT EVEREST? A devastating avalanche swept across Mount Everest after the earthquake, claiming at least eight lives with an unspecified number of people missing and injured. The avalanche struck near one of the famed mountain's most dangerous spots. It swept down between the Khumbu Icefall, known for its harsh conditions, and the base camp used by international climbing expeditions. There were unverified reports of avalanches on other parts of the mountain. Nepalese officials said some 30 people were injured at the base camp. Facebook postings by climbers suggested that some people may have been buried in their tents when the avalanche hit. Climbers and their support teams were leaving the base camp Saturday looking for safer locations. More than 4,000 climbers have scaled the 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) summit since 1953, when it was first conquered by New Zealand climber Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay. ___ HOW PREPARED IS NEPAL TO COPE WITH SUCH A CRISIS? Nepal is a relatively poor country without extensive resources despites its rich cultural heritage and spectacular mountain scenery. It has been plagued by instability in recent years, and general strikes have recently brought chaotic scenes to Kathmandu. Nepal's constitution was supposed to have been written by the Constituent Assembly that was elected in 2008, following the end of a 10-year Maoist insurgency and the overthrow of the centuries-old monarchy, but the assembly was hampered by infighting and never finished its work. The current assembly was chosen in 2013, but has faced the same problem. Neighboring Pakistan has offered help, and an international aid effort is likely to begin once Kathmandu's international airport can be reopened. ___ Associated Press writer Seth Borenstein in Washington contributed to this report.

4532.txt:Earthquake-report co-founder James Daniell, a civil and structural engineer at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology’s Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technologyin Germany, began collecting earthquake damage statistics as a childhood hobby. "I used to read the Guinness book of records back to front. I was then naturally inquisitive why all the books didn't have the same values for a particular event, and that is why I got into it," he says. The database he has since built is now the backbone of his loss model. The report relies on intensity data collected from many different sources whereas the USGS uses its own data. Daniell also says his model tracks local changes in capital stock and GDP values through time whereas the USGS makes a comparison based on past temblors in each country or region of the world.
4532.txt:The worldwide data has pointed to several long-term trends, Daniell says. One is that buildings are better, overall. Between 1900 and 2014 quake damage has decreased as a percentage of total damaged buildings. But the number of fatalities from earthquakes compared with worldwide deaths is a flat line. In this regard, "we're not doing better at all," Daniell says. He spoke to Scientific American about the aftermath of the April 25 Nepal quake and about what his numbers show about worldwide readiness for dangerous temblors.
4532.txt:There was a lot less destruction in Kathmandu that had been expected from studies before the event. These did not model exactly the magnitude and makeup of this event but it is still surprising. The economic loss is very low—not because of the damage, which is high—but because Nepal is such a poor land with very little infrastructure, around $40 billion in total infrastructure value.

4660.txt:Lifting the gloom on a day marred by more aftershocks that kept people in Nepal on edge and a rising death toll that topped the 7,200-mark, rescuers on Sunday pulled out three more survivors from under the debris of their homes who were miraculously alive eight days after the quake. Fresh aftershocks, including one measuring 4.3 on the Richter Scale, sent a new wave of panic among people, most of whom have been staying in the open battling bad weather and scarce food and water supplies following the country's worst earthquake in 80 years. At least 7,250 people have been confirmed dead from the 7.9-magnitude April 25 quake while the number of injured has risen to 14,267, with Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat saying the death toll is expected to climb "much higher". "The aftershocks have not receded, and we expect the final casualty numbers to climb much higher," said Mahat, portraying a desperately bleak situation in his comments at an event on the sidelines of an Asian Development Bank meeting in Baku. “It is with great pain and sadness that I stand before you to present the case of my country Nepal which now remains devastated," he said, adding that the quake had caused "incalculable human loss and suffering, with millions of people rendered homeless." Officials said an entire village was carried away by the avalanche and many more people are believed to have died. Meanwhile, hopes of finding more survivors were rekindled as rescuers pulled out two men and a woman alive from under mounds of debris, eight days after the devastating quake struck the Himalayan nation and three days after a teenage boy and a woman were saved. They were found near the mountainous Syauli village and have been taken to a nearby military hospital for treatment. The district — located about 60 km west from here — is the worst hit by the 7.9-magnitude temblor, with the highest number of casualties. Nepal had said chances of finding survivors buried in the rubble are "extremely slim", with Home Ministry spokesman Laxmi Dhakal saying "it will be a miracle if anyone is found alive" though he denied that administration has given up yet and that rescue teams were continuing to look.At least 38 Indians are among 54 foreigners killed in the quake that left a trail of devastation and suffering, flattening buildings and uprooting electric poles and trees. Police said 48 foreigners, including 10 Indians, were injured and 82 foreign nationals missing. Separately, 51 bodies, including of six foreigners, in the popular Langtang trekking region have been pulled out by police, a report said and quoted an official that about 100 foreigners might still be missing in the area. Twelve stranded trekkers, including an Indian national, were rescued today from Makalu Base Camp in eastern Nepal and flown to Kathmandu. Nepal parties have agreed that all those interested in carrying out relief work in the country can start at once, without having to route the process through the government. A report released by the United Nation's humanitarian agency OCHA (Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) said the number of houses destroyed in the country is over 1,60,000, nearly twice the number of households wrecked in the 1934s deadly temblor that has been the country's worst disaster of all times.The UN urged Nepal to relax customs controls which it says are holding up deliveries of aid coming from countries around the world from reaching the survivors. Nepal had a duty to provide faster customs clearance for relief supplies, said UN humanitarian chief Valerie Amos, who along with the EU's Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, Christos Stylianides called on Prime Minister Sushil Koirala and reaffirmed the commitment of the international community to support the country. "A disaster of such magnitude would test the capacities of any government in the world," said Stylianides. The country's only main airport the Tribhuvan International Airport has been closed for large aircraft due to runway damage that forced authorities to take such a step in the middle of the calamity. The runway was built to handle only medium-size jetliners, not the large military and cargo planes that have been flying emergency supplies to Nepal, said manager of the airport Birendra Shrestha. Domestic and international emergency response teams are racing against time and odds to rush in medical aid to people in worst-affected areas of the quake-hit country, including through flying in mobile clinics to far-flung villages and providing in psychological support to traumatised victims of the tragedy. Nepal lifted import taxes on tarpaulins and tents on Friday but home ministry spokesman Laxmi Prasad Dhakal said all goods arriving from abroad had to be inspected. Remote mountainous areas in the country have suffered "almost total devastation" from the powerful quake, aid agencies have warned, even as relief slowly began to reach far-flung regions. — PTI

Aftershocks tormented them, making buildings sway and sending panicked Kathmandu residents running into the streets.The cawing of crows mixed with terrified screams as the worst of the aftershocks - magnitude 6.7 - pummeled the capital city. It came as planeloads of supplies, doctors and relief workers from neighboring countries began arriving in this poor Himalayan nation. No deaths or injuries were reported from the early Sunday afternoon quake, but it took an emotional toll."The aftershocks keep coming ... so people don't know what to expect," said Sanjay Karki, Nepal country head for global aid agency Mercy Corps. "All the open spaces in Kathmandu are packed with people who are camping outdoors. When the aftershocks come you cannot imagine the fear. You can hear women and children crying."Saturday's magnitude 7.8 earthquake spread horror from Kathmandu to small villages and to the slopes of Mount Everest, triggering an avalanche that buried part of the base camp packed with foreign climbers preparing to make their summit attempts. At least 18 people died there and 61 were injured, according to the Nepal Mountaineering Association.The earthquake centered outside Kathmandu, the capital, was the worst to hit the South Asian nation in over 80 years. It destroyed swaths of the oldest neighborhoods of Kathmandu, and was strong enough to be felt all across parts of India, Bangladesh, China 's region of Tibet and Pakistan.Nepal authorities said Sunday that at least 2,430 people died in that country alone, not including the 18 dead in the avalanche. Another 61 people died from the quake in India and a few in other neighboring countries.At least 1,152 people died in Kathmandu, and the number of injured nationwide was upward of 5,900. With search and rescue efforts far from over, it was unclear how much the death toll would rise.But outside of the oldest neighborhoods, many in Kathmandu were surprised by how few modern structures - the city is largely a collection of small, poorly constructed brick apartment buildings - collapsed in the quake. While aid workers cautioned that many buildings could have sustained serious structural damage, it was also clear that the death toll would have been far higher had more buildings caved in.Aid workers also warned that the situation could be far worse near the epicenter. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake was centered near Lamjung, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu, in the Gorkha district.Roads to that area were blocked by landslides, hindering rescue teams, said chief district official Prakash Subedi. Teams were trekking through mountain trails to reach remote villages, and helicopters would also be deployed, he said by telephone.Local aid worker Matt Darvas said in a statement issued by his group, World Vision, that he heard that many remote mountain villages near the epicenter may have been completely buried by rock falls.The villages "are literally perched on the sides of large mountain faces and are made from simple stone and rock construction," Darvas said. "Many of these villages are only accessible by 4WD and then foot, with some villages hours and even entire days' walks away from main roads at the best of times."Nepal's worst recorded earthquake in 1934 measured 8.0 and all but destroyed the cities of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan.With people fearing more quakes, tens of thousands of Nepalese spent Saturday night outside under chilly skies, or in cars and public buses. They were jolted awake by strong aftershocks early Sunday."There were at least three big quakes at night and early morning. How can we feel safe? This is never-ending and everyone is scared and worried," said Kathmandu resident Sundar Sah. "I hardly got much sleep. I was waking up every few hours and glad that I was alive."As day broke, rescuers aided by international teams set out to dig through rubble of buildings - concrete slabs, bricks, iron beams, wood - to look for survivors.In the Kalanki neighborhood of Kathmandu, police rescuers finally extricated a man lying under a dead body, both of them buried beneath a pile of concrete slabs and iron beams. Before his rescue, his family members stood nearby, crying and praying. Police said the man's legs and hips were totally crushed.Hundreds of people in Kalanki gathered around the collapsed Lumbini Guest House, once a three-story budget hotel and restaurant frequented by Nepalese. They watched with fear and anticipation as a single backhoe dug into the rubble.Police officer RP Dhamala, who was coordinating the rescue efforts, said they had already pulled out 12 people alive and six dead. He said rescuers were still searching for about 20 people believed to be trapped, but had heard no cries, taps or noises for a while.Most areas were without power and water. The United Nations said hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overcrowded, and running out of emergency supplies and space to store corpses.Plumes of smoke, meanwhile, rose above the capital as friends, relatives and others gathered by the river to quickly cremate loved ones' remains.Most shops in Kathmandu were shut; only fruit vendors and pharmacies seemed to be doing business."More people are coming now," fruit seller Shyam Jaiswal said. "They cannot cook so they need to buy something they can eat raw."Jaiswal said stocks were running out, and more shipments were not expected for at least a week, but added, "We are not raising prices. That would be illegal, immoral profit."The quake will likely put a huge strain on the resources of this impoverished country best known for Everest, the highest mountain in the world. The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, relies heavily on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain climbing.With Kathmandu airport reopened, the first aid flights began delivering aid supplies. The first to respond were Nepal's neighbors - India, China and Pakistan, all of which have been jockeying for influence over the landlocked nation. Nepal remains closest to India, with which it shares deep political, cultural and religious ties.India suffered its own losses from the quake, with at least 61 people killed there and dozens injured. Sunday's aftershock was also widely felt in the country, and local news reports said metro trains in New Delhi and Kolkata were briefly shut down when the shaking started.Other countries sending support Sunday included the United Arab Emirates, Germany and France.After the chaos of Saturday - when little organized rescue and relief was seen - there was more order on Sunday as rescue teams fanned out across the city.Workers were sending out tents and relief goods in trucks and helicopters and setting up shelters, said disaster management official Rameshwar Dangal. Mukesh Kafle, the head of the Nepal Electricity Authority, said power was restored to main government offices, the airport and hospitals.Among the destroyed buildings in Kathmandu was the nine-story Dharahara Tower, a Kathmandu landmark built by Nepal's royal rulers as a watchtower in the 1800s and a UNESCO-recognized historical monument. It was reduced to rubble and there were reports of people trapped underneath.The Kathmandu Valley is listed as a World Heritage site. The Buddhist stupas, public squares and Hindu temples are some of the most well-known sites in Kathmandu, and now some of the most deeply mourned.Nepali journalist and author Shiwani Neupane tweeted: "The sadness is sinking in. We have lost our temples, our history, the places we grew up."Con InformaciÃ³n de

Thousands of 'theplas' and tonnes of 'sukhdi', both Gujarati delicacies with long shelf lives, are being dispatched from this central suburb to Kathmandu every day.Soon after the earthquake struck, Gokul Vraj Foundation started to roll out its relief package. Mangal Bhanushali, a member, said, "Since food was scarce in Nepal, we appealed to people through Whatsapp to provide theplas and sukhdi as an extension of India's Operation Maitri to help Nepal. Food items are transported to cargo centres and railway stations in tempos or personal vehicles more than thrice a day. Customs officials are helpful and the airlines too fly out the food for free."In all, nine centres have been opened across Mumbai and people can pick a drop-off point for their food parcels at a centre closest to their house. In the northern suburbs, Pawan Dham, Kandivli, collects the parcels which are dispatched to the main centre at Brahman Samaj Hall in Ghatkopar (E). Here these parcels are sorted, packed and dispatched via cargo through air. In Nepal, the food items are collected and distributed via Seva Bharati.Bhanushali said that as many as 8,000 households in Mumbai were supporting the endeavour. Gayatri Bhadra, a volunteer said, "We spend close to 8-9 hours a day sorting out the parcels. They are packed in waterproof material to prevent rain damage."

When I was in Haiti two years later, to research the relief effort for a book, I was shocked to discover that no one could tell me with any precision if there was ever a food or water shortage in the first place. No one among the responders had even contacted the Coordination Nationale de la Sécurité Alimentaire — the Haitian government agency overseeing food security — to find out what might be needed. Indeed, earthquakes tend to inflict the worst damage on cities, not farms — especially in countries that already have limited infrastructure — and Haiti’s urban areas didn’t have any sewers or piped drinking water to begin with.

4830.txt:Kathmandu (AFP) May 3, 2015 - A 101-year-old man was pulled alive from the rubble of his house in Nepal seven days after it collapsed in a deadly earthquake, police said Sunday. Kathmandu (AFP) May 3, 2015 - A 101-year-old man was pulled alive from the rubble of his house in Nepal seven days after it collapsed in a deadly earthquake, police said Sunday. Funchu Tamang was rescued on Saturday with only minor injuries and airlifted to a district hospital, local police officer Arun Kumar Singh told AFP. "He was brought to the district hospital in a helicopter. His condition is stable," said Singh in Nuwakot district around 80 kilometres (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu. "He has injuries on his left ankle and hand. His family is with him." Police also rescued three women from under rubble on Sunday in Sindupalchowk, one of the districts worst hit by the quake, although it was not immediately known how long they had been trapped. One had been buried by a landslide while the other two were under the rubble of a collapsed house. "They are being taken to hospital for treatment," said Suraj Khadka, an officer with the Armed Police Force in Kathmandu. Nepal's government had on Saturday ruled out finding more survivors buried in the ruins of Kathmandu. Multiple teams of rescuers from more than 20 countries have been using sniffer dogs and heat-seeking equipment to find survivors in the rubble of the capital. But outside the city search and rescue work has largely been carried out by local police and troops. More than a week after Nepal's devastating earthquake, large swathes of the Himalayan nation have yet to receive any outside help as aid workers battle landslides, avalanches and a helicopter shortage to reach communities in some of the world's remotest terrain. Relief workers say it is now a race against time to get desperately needed shelter, food and clean water to survivors in the far-flung mountain villages flattened by the disaster before the monsoon rains begin in June. But many of the worst-hit communities are tiny villages perched on the side of mountains that are inaccessible by road and where it is difficult or impossible for helicopters to land. The country's poor infrastructure and a weak national government beset by in-fighting among coalition partners have compounded the difficulties of mounting a vast emergency relief operation in the world's highest mountains. "One of the big challenges of working in Nepal, and we knew that this would happen should a major earthquake happen here, is the nature of the terrain," the UN humanitarian chief Valerie Amos told AFP in Kathmandu. "There are a lot of villages which are on the top of hills, they're quite small villages but there are no real roads that go up to those villages, and we know that there are quite a few areas like that because the epicentre is in a mountainous region. "It's not been possible to land even small helicopters (in some places) because there have been landslides." - 'Calamity of enormous proportions' - Indian Air Force pilot Avik Abhijit S Bali described how he had to abandon efforts to rescue survivors from a remote village in Gorkha, one of the worst-hit districts, because he could not land. "We tried for 20 minutes but there was no possibility of landing in a village that was on a slope and covered in debris from collapsed houses," he told AFP. The Nepal government has said it faces a severe shortage of both helicopters and heavy machinery to clear roads blocked by landslides after the 7.8-magnitude quake that hit on April 25, killing more than 7,000 people and flattening entire villages. The army has just seven helicopters of its own and while India has lent the country another six for rescue and relief efforts it desperately needs more help to transport aid materials. "This was a calamity of enormous proportions and the relief operations have been a challenge given the resources we have," said Information Minister Minendra Rijal. "We are putting all our resources into increasing the effectiveness of our relief efforts. We have deployed people to reach every affected district by air, road or even on foot." - 90% of homes destroyed - With authorities saying up to 90 percent of homes in the two worst-affected districts have been destroyed, the United Nations says providing shelter is the priority. It estimates more than eight million survivors are in need of aid, and says it has received reports of desperate survivors clamouring to get onto helicopters evacuating the badly wounded from rural areas and forcing relief trucks off the road. "Remarkably few modern, concrete, buildings have been affected in the capital," said Nepal expert and former UN official John Bevan in a blog post this week. "In the countryside, however, most buildings are old, made of mud or weak bricks and stand on vertiginous slopes. These are the remote hill villages which it would appear have borne the main brunt of the quake." Amos said there had been reports of some areas getting repeated aid deliveries, while others had still received nothing. "What we do know is that there is a lot more need out there than the places we are able to get to," she said. "Our priority now is really to try to reach those people, get immediate assistance to them." The government of landlocked Nepal has also faced criticism for holding up foreign relief deliveries at customs, with reports of aid trucks being turned away at the border with India because they did not have the correct documentation. Kathmandu's tiny international airport has been operating round the clock to allow aid flights to land, but a shortage of parking space has meant some have had to be turned away. On Sunday it said it was imposing a weight restrictions on planes for fear that the only runway may have sustained damage in the quake and the multiple aftershocks that have followed. "This runway is the only lifeline for Kathmandu," said airport manager Birendra Prasad Shrestha. "If it goes, everything goes." Thanks for being here;

4933.txt:PANITANKI (Indo-Nepal border): Three months back, in February, chief minister Mamata Banerjee flew the 466km distance from Kolkata to Dhaka to send a message that she is finally willing to look beyond Bengal in broader national interest. On Monday, she walked the 1km — from Panitanki to Kakarbhitta — to send a similar message to another neighbour.Like in Dhaka, her trip to Nepal on Monday to help quake-affected victims left an impact.Before boarding the Bagdogra flight, Mamata told reporters, "There is scarcity of some things in Nepal, which its government has sought from us. I am carrying those things." Nepal responded to Mamata's helping hand with warmth.Nepal urban development minister Dr Narayan Kharke, who was also present, expressed gratitude for this gesture."On the behalf of the Nepal government, I would like to express my gratitude to the government and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. We are thankful for getting such support," Kharke said.Chandra Prasad Chithala, a Kakarbhitta local, appeared overwhelmed at this gesture. "Since April 25 we have seen several relief laden trucks cross over to Nepal from India. But today was different for its precision. The relief was handed over to the government and the Nepal Army, which will then re-distribute them. A lot of relief materials are not reaching the beneficiaries for they are being distributed by private agencies in a haphazard manner," he said.Gopal Chandra, another local, said, "Relief should reach the people who need it. We hope this effort, because it was coordinated by the two governments, is of help to the affected. We are grateful to the West Bengal chief minister."Mamata said, "Today, I have come to Panitanki in Siliguri near Nepal border to provide relief materials to our brothers and sisters of Nepal, who are in great distress due to devastating earthquake. Our hearts are full of sorrow for them. As a gesture of solidarity, friendship, goodwill, brotherhood and to strengthen our relations, West Bengal government has launched cross-border humanitarian exercise of distribution of relief materials of blankets, tarpaulins, water pouches and many more lifesaving items. We are with our brothers and sisters of Nepal and committed to offer them our support. We wish for Nepal to smile, overcoming their sorrow and human tragedy."Mamata had visited Siliguri on April 26, a day after the devastating earthquake that hit the Himalayan country, to take stock of the damage in North Bengal. North Bengal reported three deaths — one each in Jalpaiguri, Naxalbari and Siliguri — due to the quake. Nearly 80 injured persons were admitted to a Siliguri government hospital. The CM, according to senior officers, wanted to flag off the relief-laden trucks from Panitanki itself. However, in a change of plans she walked to Kakarbhitta and spent nearly an hour at the cultural office. The formal handover was made there.
4936.txt:ONE AMONGST MANY: The China International Rescue Team recovers a local survivor from a collapsed building in Kathmandu on April 26 (BAI YANG) An 8.1-magnitude earthquake devastated Nepal on April 25. The earthquake was so powerful that it shifted the ground beneath Kathmandu, Nepal's capital, by as much as three meters to the south, according to the Nepalese authorities. The world has now turned its eyes to the earthquake's aftermath, as images broadcast from Nepal shook the international community. The death toll in Nepal has surpassed 5,000 and is still climbing as authorities and law enforcement rush to confirm local people's whereabouts. Nepal's Prime Minister Sushil Koirala projected that the death toll may well reach over 10,000. The earthquake, which also affected neighboring areas of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, may not even be over, as survivors await possible strong aftershocks that often follow the initial quake. STILL STANDING: Nepalese rescue members gather at the collapsed Darahara Tower in Kathmandu on April 25 (XINHUA/AFP) Fearing for our own Famous for its scenery at the Himalayas and its rich cultural heritage, Nepal attracts over half a million tourists all over the world every year. Tourists enjoy hiking and mountain climbing. Chinese and Indian citizens together account for 36 percent of foreign tourists in Nepal, according to the country's tourism authorities. Thanks to more air routes, increasing numbers of Chinese tourists have chosen Nepal as a tourist destination in recent years. Of those Chinese tourists, 6,000 were in Nepal when the earthquake took place. Li Qiong, a 25-year-old tour guide, was in a town near Kathmandu. She immediately assembled all 21 of her group members, and fortunately, no one was injured. The group had traveled from north China's Shanxi Province to Nepal for a 10-day trip. Over the past five years, Li had often accompanied Chinese tourists to Nepal, but the sudden earthquake turned the relatively familiar terrain into a nightmare for her. "Many old buildings that we had just visited and taken photos of in the morning collapsed within three minutes as earthquake shook in the afternoon," Li recalled. The nightmare continued throughout the 30 minutes following the earthquake, during which aftershocks hit repeatedly. "A local tour guide took us to the open ground of Durbar Square to avoid the dangers of the aftershocks," Li said. SOLIDARITY AMONG CHAOS: People clear rubble in Kathmandu's Durbar Square, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that was severely damaged by the earthquake on April 25 (XINHUA/AFP) However, for Li, the reality of the earthquake's destruction didn't begin to hit her until she processed the damage with her own eyes. "I just couldn't believe that we were survivors of a devastating earthquake until we walked through the ruins of buildings," Li said. The next day, Li's travel agency helped these tourists board an airliner which took them back to Lhasa in China. On the way to the airport of Kathmandu, Li and her group members made donations to their local Nepalese tour guide and driver. "We are grateful for everything they've risked," Li said. "They were with us the whole time after the quake. They did not go home for their families until their job was finished." Li and her tour group's homecoming was emotional, to say the least. "We all burst into tears when we arrived at Lhasa airport and saw the electric board which said 'welcome home.' We were moved because so many people cared about us, and our country did the best to bring us home," Li said. SAFE AND SOUND: A total of 100 Chinese and 15 foreign travelers on board a China Southern Airlines plane land in Guangzhou Baiyun airport on April 26 (HUANG GUOBAO) Foreign travelers flocked to Kathmandu's airport after the earthquake, and the airport struggled to accommodate its passengers in the wake of the damage. Many countries have performed similar efforts to evacuate their citizens. Chinese embassy diplomats in Nepal got in touch with every Chinese citizen known to be in the quake-stricken region as soon as possible. Major Chinese airlines added planes to Kathmandu to evacuate Chinese citizens. As of April 27, Chinese airlines have taken 1,809 passengers back home, according to Guangzhou-based Southern Metropolis Daily in south China's Guangdong Province. In addition to the devastation that swept Nepal, the quake also triggered deadly avalanches on Mount Qomolangma, known as Mount Everest in the West, swallowing nearly 20 foreign mountaineers including Daniel Fredinburg, a 33-year-old Google executive. Hundreds of people were trapped in the base camp on the mountainside. Mount Qomolangma's climate is already harsh, a situation only made worse by the earthquake. Around 40 Chinese mountaineers making up four teams were on the south slope of Mount Qomolangma when the quake came. Mountaineering organizations have commissioned helicopters to rescue survivors stranded on Mount Qomolangma. Li Zhixin, President of the Chinese Mountaineering Association (CMA), told Beijing-based Global Times that most mountaineers chose to climb the mountain in April and May because of the agreeable weather. SEEKING HAVEN: Survivors gather at a square in Kathmandu and try to escape from aftershocks on April 26 (XINHUA) The CMA had warned that, if a natural disaster were to occur, the chances for survival for the large number of mountaineers camping on route to Mount Qomolangma would be slim, Li said. There is little possibility for surviving an avalanche. In the face of nature, humans are simply too small, Li said. International aid While foreign citizens were evacuated, international rescuers and aid have been arriving in the country to help cope with the damage dealt by the worst earthquake to hit Nepal in over 80 years. The international community has joined with Nepalese forces to search for survivors under the rubble of collapsed buildings in quake-hit areas. On April 26, the Chinese Government announced it would offer 20 million yuan ($3.22 million) in aid to Nepal. The Red Cross Society of China delivered the first 186 tons of emergency supplies to the earthquake-stricken country from Beijing on April 27. In addition to supplies, China took quick action to send disaster relief forces to Nepal as well as disaster areas in China's Tibet, in the hope of saving as many as possible in the "golden 72 hours," after which the chance of finding earthquake survivors diminishes immensely. China has been improving its disaster relief capacity and resources since a devastating earthquake, which took the lives of nearly 70,000, struck southwest China's Sichuan Province in 2008. China International Rescue Team, consisting of 62 members and six trained hounds, arrived in Kathmandu on the morning of April 26. Taking advantage of their proximity to Nepal, they were the first international team in the country and immediately set to work upon their arrival. That afternoon, they successfully recovered a survivor. SIGHT OF HOPE: A rescue helicopter prepares to land and airlift the injured from Mount Qomolangma South Base Camp in Nepal on April 26, a day after an avalanche triggered by the 8.1-magnitude earthquake devastated the camp (XINHUA/AFP) Meanwhile, four IL-76 aircraft of Chinese Air Force were sent to carry humanitarian aid and a 58-person medical team to Nepal, announced Shen Jinke, spokesman for the Chinese Air Force in Beijing. Zhou Shengping, Xinhua News Agency's correspondent in Kathmandu, said that Nepal's rescue mission faced many difficulties. Nepal's rescue forces were overworked in the days following the quake. Tired and struggling to find effective tools, they continued to search, as the country's need was too great for them to rest. The lack of aircraft slows down rescue missions in Nepal, because many roads leading to disaster-hit mountainous areas were destroyed by the quake and subsequent landslide. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has opened its high-resolution satellite graphics of Nepal's quake-hit areas in a bid to streamline rescue work and avoid casualties from possible future disasters, including landslides and glacier collapses. In the meantime, the international community has also extended a hand to Nepal. India, another neighboring country of Nepal, offered several aircraft carrying medical supplies and a mobile hospital, as well as a disaster response team. The United States delivered a disaster response team and an initial $1 million in aid. Pakistan sent four C-130 aircraft carrying a rescue team and medical doctors as well as disaster relief supplies to Nepal. Despite the timely aid from other countries and rescue efforts, one thing is clear: Aid for the broken hearts of Nepal can't come fast enough, and it will take a long time to even begin to recover from the devastation that has rocked the country.

5057.txt:JS: While the earthquake affected many different parts of Nepal, people have been affected differently by the earthquake. For example, it’s different if you’re in an urban environment or a rural environment. In the rural communities, particularly in the uplands like this, damage to homes has been much more severe, because of the construction methods. The impact of the earthquake has affected many more aspects of their lives, so we’re very concerned about safe shelters – the monsoon is only two weeks away.

When we arrived emotions were running high and the conditions at the scene were very difficult. In the first moments it was truly difficult to get an exact picture of the situation and to know how many Israelis were injured and missing and what their medical condition was. We were busy trying to trace the Israelis with whom contact had been lost. Side by side with these tasks we joined up with the local medical teams and the Red Cross teams in order to give medical and humanitarian aid to the wounded who arrived at the hospitals in Katmandu. Over and above providing medical treatment to the Israelis, we found ourselves helping wherever possible, starting with changing diapers on the babies, and since there were no ground services at the airport we even helped load the cases of the parents and families onto the plane.

5124.txt:-- As Americans watch from a safe distance the earthquake damage that has occurred in Nepal, students at Georgia Campus – Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine (GA-PCOM) are preparing for a trip to Nepal this summer and thinking back to their relationship with this country built through a Nepalese American student and the campus’ International Medicine Club (IMC).Alok Shrestha, a third year medical student currently on rotation in Dothan, Al., traveled to Nepal for the first time in 20 years the year before he started medical school. Born in Nepal, Shrestha moved with his family to the United States when he was a young child. Most of his extended family still lives in Nepal and are safe, despite the earthquake’s devastation. Before his trip to Nepal in 2012, he wondered, “Would I be able to understand my own family? Would they see me as an outsider?” He soon learned that “family is family. I hadn't seen them in 20 years but they welcomed me with open arms as if we grew up together all along.” He said, “The first few days were definitely a culture shock for me, but I was amazed by the rich culture and natural beauty Nepal had to offer. I was also saddened by realizing how much help the people of Nepal needed. Although Nepal had been progressing over the past couple of decades, it was doing so at a much slower rate than many of the other Asian countries,” he observed. “I could see that much of the infrastructure in Nepal like the roads, telephones, internet, electricity, water supply, sanitation system, and health care had not matured very much.”After his trip, Shrestha thought about how he could give back to his homeland. He decided to coordinate with Dr. Jayahari Pandey of a Lion's Club International chapter in Kathmandu and planned a trip for five GA-PCOM medical students to go to Nepal the next summer. That was the first GA-PCOM IMC medical mission trip to the village of Jhor in Kathmandu, Nepal. They raised money for the trip throughout the year through school luncheons, web sites, social media, emails, and good, old-fashioned word of mouth.The group raised about $3,500, and each of the team members paid for their own plane tickets. Through their efforts, they were able to run a health post in Jhor for 11 days. Before their arrival, the health post offered only a handful of supplies so local village volunteers could help treat minor ailments. The money raised by the students was able to provide more extensive medical supplies, pharmaceutical drugs, and operating funds for running the clinic. Students worked together with Nepali doctors, including general practitioners, orthopedic doctors, ENTs, and OB/GYNs, while several young, local volunteers translated and managed patient traffic.At the end of the trip, the team was surprised to learn that they had provided care and treatment for approximately 650 patients in the village and surrounding areas. “It was a very rewarding experience to have been a part of this journey and I am also really proud of the GA-PCOM students who went on the second trip in 2014 and those who are raising funds for the third much needed trip this summer,” Shrestha said.Though their experience will be quite different from the trips of their predecessors, this year’s group of students headed to Nepal feel a sense of urgency to help now more than ever. “We will be seeing much more widespread and severe cases on the medical side, and will most likely be helping with more laborious tasks like clean-up and rebuilding. The need for help has exceeded our expectations by far, but this gives us all the more reason to go,” said Cheryl Moreton, one of the seven IMC club members headed to Nepal this summer.Jeffrey Williams, another student who will be joining Moreton and the others, added, “To me, an opportunity like this is what ultimately makes becoming a physician worthwhile.”To support the College's IMC club members in this endeavor, please visit their GoFundMe page: http://www.gofundme.com/ nepalmission2015 Georgia Campus – Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine (GA-PCOM) is a private, not-for-profit branch campus of the fully accredited Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, a multi-program institution with a 116-year tradition of educational excellence.

5138.txt:Runway damage closes Kathmandu airport; death toll rises
5138.txt:KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) -- Runway damage forced Nepalese authorities to close the main airport Sunday to large aircraft delivering aid to millions of people following the massive earthquake, but U.N. officials said the overall logistics situation was improving.
5138.txt:The airport's main runway was temporarily closed to big planes because of damage. It was built to handle only medium-size jetliners, but not the large military and cargo planes that have been flying in aid supplies, food, medicines, and rescue and humanitarian workers, said Birendra Shrestha, the manager of Tribhuwan International Airport, located on the outskirts of Kathmandu.
5138.txt:The true extent of the damage from the earthquake is still unknown as reports keep filtering in from remote areas, some of which remain entirely cut off. The U.N. says the quake affected 8.1 million people -- more than a quarter of Nepal's 28 million people.

5144.txt:Relief supplies for earthquake victims have been piling up at the airport and in warehouses here because of bureaucratic interference by Nepalese authorities who insist that standard customs inspections and other procedures be followed, even in an emergency, Western government and aid organization officials said Sunday."The bottleneck was the fact that the bureaucratic procedures were just so heavy," Jamie McGoldrick, the U.N. resident coordinator, said in an interview. "So many layers of government and so many departments involved, so many different line ministries involved. We don't need goods sitting in Kathmandu warehouses. We don't need goods sitting at the airport. We need them up in the affected areas."The U.S. ambassador to Nepal, Peter W. Bodde, said he had spoken to Nepal's prime minister, Sushil Koirala, about the issue and "he assured me that all the red tape will be stopped."Also Sunday, three survivors were pulled from rubble in the Sindhupalchok district, an especially hard-hit and largely rural area north of Kathmandu.Officials of aid organizations and Western governments have been grumbling about the Nepalese government since the magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck the country April 25, killing more than 7,000 people. Early complaints accused the government of all but disappearing, a criticism that even top officials here acknowledged was fair."Everyone was panicked, everything was closed, and we all tried to save our own lives," Purna Bahadur Khadka, joint general secretary of the governing Nepali Congress, said in an interview at the prime minister's official residence. "And some critics can say there was no proper coordination for the first two days."But sometime over the past week, the government revived, Khadka said. And that is when, Western aid officials say, government officials began insisting that an entire list of rules must be followed, even for emergency relief supplies.Bodde said it was a problem that the United States intended to help fix, as a huge C-17 transport plane unloaded a UH-17 helicopter and, separately, four Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft flew into Nepal on Sunday to help carry supplies from Kathmandu to devastated rural areas."That's why we're here today," Bodde said as the C-17 rolled to a stop.But even that help had been delayed, according to Marine Lt. Col. Edward Powers, the helicopter pilot."We've been sitting on a ramp in Okinawa for the last 72 hours" waiting for permission to land at Kathmandu, Powers said at the airport.Minendra Rijal, the minister for information and communication and the government's official spokesman, denied that the government had slowed any delivery of aid."The accusations are false," Rijal said in a telephone interview. "It would be better if the U.N. involved itself more in its duties rather than engaging in criticizing the government."Yet McGoldrick said that delays were occurring not only at the Kathmandu airport but at border crossings with India and even at district headquarters across the country, and Nepalese journalists have quoted customs officials at the Indian border crossings as affirming that relief supplies needed to "go through strict inspections."McGoldrick said that while the government had loosened its requirements in the past day, time was essential."Planting season is six weeks away, and if you miss that you'll need to deliver food aid for another three months," he said. "The monsoon is coming in eight weeks. So it's very precarious."District officials said in a series of interviews that food and tents had yet to reach some remote villages because of transportation problems, not bureaucracy."The food supply is OK in the villages surrounding district headquarters, but we have not yet been able to make any normal supply in remoter parts of the districts," said Basudev Ghimire, the chief district officer of Dhading district.Anil Kumar Thakur, the chief district officer of Bhaktapur district, said bureaucratic requirements had prevented most distributions of cash under a plan to compensate families who suffered deaths."Although we have already started to distribute cash relief, it is not going well," Thakur added. "It requires verification letters from police and other documents that establishes relations with the deceased one."The bureaucracy and political machinery in Nepal are unusually independent of each other, which has mostly been a good thing over the past 10 years as the political process has been paralyzed by squabbling. Bureaucracy officials, however, take their jobs very seriously, and some might fear that if they do not document all aid distributions, they could later face accusations that they kept the goods for themselves.Outside Kathmandu, more victims of the earthquake were still being discovered. In the Langtang Valley in the northern Rasuwa district, according to Reuters, a police team found the bodies of about 50 people, including some foreigners, on a popular trekking route.Also Sunday, civil aviation authorities announced that they had closed the Kathmandu airport to the largest jets, or those weighing more than 196 metric tons, for fear they could damage the runways."We feared that the possible damage of our only international airport would invite further problems in the post-quake scenario, so the landing of heavy planes has now been restricted," said Birendra Prasad Shrestha, the airport's acting general manager.Shrestha said the government and humanitarian organizations involved in providing relief to earthquake victims are mounting pressure to lift that ban. "But we are not in favor" of doing so, he said, adding that permission for the C-17 to land had been arranged previously.

"The fact of the matter is that the Indian military aircrafts are operating in full coordination and consultation with the Nepalese Army. A Liaison Officer of the Nepalese Army accompanies each flight," the Indian Embassy spokesperson said. "All Indian Air Force flights take place in accordance with the decision of the Nepalese Army. Indian Air Force and Army do not have any direct linkage with Chief District Officers and District Authorities," the spokesperson added. Indian helicopters carry relief material of various countries including India, handed over by the Nepalese Army, the Embassy stated. "So, the presumption in the news report that the Indian helicopters are carrying relief material without coordinating with the Nepalese authorities is completely baseless," it said. PTI

Peace, amity and cooperation is the quintessence of the DOC, which reflects the political desire and wisdom of China and ASEAN countries to keep the situation stable and promote friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation. The DOC has no direct bearing on issues concerning the sovereignty of maritime features, nor does it empower the Philippines to encroach upon China's Nansha Islands. There is not a single item in the DOC that can justify the Philippines' action of illegally taking away China's islands and reefs before 2002, or back up the Philippines' illegal expansion and construction on the relevant maritime features. The DOC is not a tool for the Philippines to whitewash its wrongdoings. The Philippines' willful abuse and distortion of the DOC is in itself a breach and damage to the DOC.

Even agencies that were prone not to work with the military suddenly realised that you couldn't do that kind of operation without the military – they were essential to it. And they provided a tremendous service of logistics support and helicopter transport. Unless that’s organised here and we start to operate like that, it’ll be a long time before these people get the help they need.”
5345.txt:The reality is that for a long time it has been widely known amongst experts that a major earthquake was going to strike: it was not a question of ‘if’ but ‘when.’ The extensive damage and loss of life is not because of the earthquake itself, although many of Nepal’s towns and cities are located across fault lines, but rather down to poor governance, lack of investment in infrastructure, loose adherence to building codes in densely populated areas and high levels of poverty. In all, these factors compounded vulnerabilities making the impact of the disaster more significant than in a context with modern infrastructure and stable socio-economic conditions. The government of Nepal has taken steps to improve existing infrastructure and enforce legislation on new developments, including training masons on earthquake building techniques for non-engineered buildings and retrofitting of hospitals and schools. Additionally, the Nepal Risk Reduction Consortium has assisted the government to understand and address key vulnerabilities to natural hazards. However these efforts have been undermined given that before this drive by the government lay decades of substandard buildings; in Kathmandu, many thousands of houses have been too expensive to retrofit, which contributed to the widespread destruction. Further, despite Nepal finalising its National Strategy for Disaster Risk Management, years of political instability since has inhibited significant progress towards the implementation of strategies that would have limited the scale of damage we have seen with the April 25th earthquake.

Main roads are open. However, landslides have challenged transportation of relief items to some areas. Many affected villages are without road access at all.Access to districts beyond the Valley continues to be a major challenge. In some places, relief trucks have been stopped and diverted by communities. This poses additional challenges to the Government and humanitarian partners who work around the clock to transport aid to those in need.

The photo, taken in 2012, shows the Boudha Stupa on the outskirts of Nepal's capital, Kathmandu. [Photo: CRIENGLISH.com] The numerous temples and historic monuments destroyed in the massive earthquake in Nepal last month represent a dramatic loss of culture, with repairs and reconstruction expected to last for decades. CRI's Tu Yun brings you a close of the historical sites. 0507party.mp3 Piles of bricks, wooden beams, and other debris are littered throughout Patan Durbar Square in Nepal's capital, Kathmandu. "I am deeply hurt. I can't put it into words. I feel really, really bad. I don't know how I will heal." "I feel like this is now a graveyard. This is where we played, where we grew up. Seeing all these temples destroyed I feel so depressed. I just can't describe it." At least 14 historic buildings have been destroyed or severely damaged in the quake, including 12 on the UNESCO World Heritage list. The iconic 9-storey Dharahara tower, a major tourist attraction in Kathmandu which was nearly 200 years old, has been reduced to just its base. The country's oldest Swayambhunath temple, which was built 2,500 years ago, was also damaged. The United Nation's cultural agency, UNESCO, is describing the scale of damage caused by the earthquake as "very rare" among any natural disaster in modern history. This could be a deadly blow to the country's tourism industry, which accounts for around 8-percent of Nepal's GDP. Ye Liang, a Chinese Buddhist teacher based in Kathmandu, suggests rebuilding the main structures within a year or two. "If we can draw enough manpower to reconstruct the main buildings of the destroyed historical sites in one or two years, it will not impose much impact on Nepal's tourism. Later, we can rebuilt other buildings gradually." Wang Bing with the Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture says the reconstruction work still faces a lot of difficulties. "Nepal of course will put relief work and humanitarian aid on the top agenda. They have to settle down residents who lost their homes in the quake and repair damaged infrastructure. Only after that, they can spare hand to embark on cultural sites reconstruction." Cultural officials in Nepal agree the reconstruction work will be challenging, with very high costs and a lack of technology and technical manpower. However, UNESCO Representative to Nepal Christian Manhart is quite optimistic as they have architectural features like sculptures, carved wooden beams, cornerstones, which can be reused. "We have detailed photographs, we have architectural plans and drawings, we have measurements, so this will be a very good basis for future reconstruction but of course it will be extremely costly and the government of Nepal and UNESCO we are counting very much on the international solidarity to help with this enormous task." The cultural agency is currently preparing to field an international expert mission to undertake an in-depth damage assessment and then advise and provide support to the Nepalese authorities and local communities on the protection and conservation of the damage.
5598.txt:It is said the assessment will take two or three months. An earthquake estimated at an 8.0 hit the country in 1935, causing significant damage to many of Nepal's major temples.

5599.txt:There is still a heavy price to be paid to get some of the ventures off the ground. More than 25,000 residents could be displaced by the 63-kilometre-long reservoir to be created by flooding low-lying regions for the Budhi Gandaki project. At West Seti, more than 20,000 families may require resettling, the government says. Yet the predominant feeling among locals in the Budhi Gandaki area appears to be one of support for the project, the scale of which renders its realisation a matter of national pride. Still, the rush to invest by Nepal's neighbouring superpowers has heightened fears of poorly planned projects that will destabilise the landscape, threaten long-term water security and exact a high toll on the environment, FDI says. The safety risks have been brought to the fore by the fatal quake, with reports of severe damage to at least one project, the Rasuwagadhi hydropower dam under construction by China Three Gorges about 100 kilometres north-west of Kathmandu near the Tibetan border.

5662.txt:MUMBAI: Within days of the Nepal earthquake, it has become clear that the biggest victim of the disaster — apart from the hapless citizens and the centuries-old heritage — has been the country's tourism industry. Nepal is popular for it's many temples. Pashupatinath, Dakshinkali, Boudanath and Swayambhunath are some of the most visited pilgrimage sites. This is the reason why people from all over the world travel here, to offer their prayers.However, the earthquake and its aftershocks have left many people from Mumbai wary of travelling to this hilly country. Due to this, almost all travel and tour operators have cancelled trips to Nepal during the current summer holidays.Dhaval Shah, a city-based tour operator says, "We had booked tickets for approximately 40 people for a trip around Kathmandu and Pokhara, out of which five were newly-married couples. However, now with the city in shambles, we have to cancel all the bookings. This has caused enough damage to our business and will take almost two to six months before tourists can start visiting Nepal."Talking about cancelling trips at the last moment, Vrinda Nagpal, a tour consultant says, "We had many tourists flying to Nepal on the day the earthquake happened and the next day as well. Thankfully, much before our clients could board the flight we had to cancel the bookings. However, we suffered huge losses because some of the tickets were booked about three months in advance. Further, we also had to deal with a few annoying clients who wanted a refund on their flight and hotel tickets right away, which was difficult on our part, because our money was stuck with the travel operators in Nepal."Chiranjeevi Bhattarai, a 28-year-old digital advertising professional says, "I was about to travel with my parents to Nepal (my hometown) for a family get-together. We usually schedule our annual trip to the place at this time of the year. We still had another two days left to go, when this disaster took place. Since I had planned the travel almost a month back, there is no way I could get a refund on the flight tickets. That apart, since I had also taken about two week off from work, I will now have to think of another destination where we can go."Housewife and mother-of-two, Dikshita Yadav says, "This is the time when my kids get a long summer vacation and my husband takes leave from work. We had planned a trip to Leh Ladakh and then to Nepal. We were supposed to travel mid-May. However, the tour operators informed us that they are cancelling all the bookings for Nepal, so now our travel plan stands for only Leh and Ladakh."Hemant Aadekar, a travel professional based in the central suburbs says, "We are now recommending our clients to other tourist destinations in South-East Asia. Some countries like Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam, which are other popular travel choices."

In geological terms, the state falls in the ‘safe’ zone as the alluvium cover acts a ‘shock absorber’.

It breaks my heart when I look around."The 7.9-magnitude earthquake that hit on April 25 has devastated the Himalayan nation's rich cultural heritage and left the Kathmandu Valley's three former royal squares in ruins.The squares, which date back to when the valley was divided into three Hindu kingdoms, are at the heart of local life as well as being a huge draw to a country that relies heavily on tourist dollars."The quake left an impact on 90 per cent of our heritage sites. It is difficult to value the loss," said Bhesh Narayan Dahal, the director general of the Department of Archaeology."The very next day after the earthquake, a team was deployed to assess the damage and make an inventory of what was found."Our concern is to not let any antiquity or items of value to leave the site. Our teams are working to keep a record and collect details."The UN's culture agency UNESCO said the damage to the three squares in Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur - all world heritage sites - was "absolutely dramatic"."We are in contact with the government and pushing them very hard to protect these sites and not to increase this damage now," said Christian Manhart, head of UNESCO in Nepal.In Patan Durbar Square on Friday, 500 Nepalese police officers and soldiers were combing through the rubble to try to salvage what they could for reconstruction."We worked all yesterday and have been working since early this morning... This is our heritage, and we have to protect it," police deputy superintendent Prakash Sharma told AFP on the square.As soldiers stacked bricks and surveyed the scene from huge piles of rubble, local people -- many of them elderly men and women in traditional Nepalese costume -- gathered behind a rope hastily erected to keep them off the usually bustling square.To one side, people lined up with buckets to collect water from the ornate stone taps of a traditional Nepalese step well that appeared to have survived the devastation."We have survived a human war, but this is nature's war on us," said Sharma, who indicated he was concerned about possible looting of priceless artefacts in the chaotic aftermath of a quake that killed thousands."We have stopped public access because not everyone has the right intention. We have cut off the area and been providing security to the ruins as much as possible," he said.UNESCO's Manhart said there were detailed drawings and architectural plans, meaning the monuments could be rebuilt, as many were following the last major quake to hit the valley in 1934.He also said the agency would work to make the centuries-old monuments more resistant to quakes in the future."We will deploy all our resources to reconstruct the sites within five to seven years," said Dahal of the Department of Archaeology."This is our pride, our identity and we will work to rebuild it."

People living under tents are still terrorised due the subsequent aftershocks, which could still be felt days after the initial big quake.
6050.txt:Nepal is in a state of national mourning. The damage to heritage sites like the three Durbar Squares in Basantapur, Patan, and Bhaktapur, the Buddhist stupa of Swayambhu, the Changu Narayan temple, the landmark Dharahara causes heartache. The most important thing for now is to save the remnants, like the statues, tudals, idols, and all the historically important artefacts from being stolen and lost. All conscious citizens must be involved in this process.

In major cities, petrol and diesel traffic constitutes a threat to many historic buildings owing to emissions of sulphur dioxide and other harmful substances, according to the Council of Europe Publications on Cultural Heritage. The interest of civil society at large should guarantee the protection of the remaining and rebuilt heritage sites.

6069.txt:In a 2014 interview, French geologist Paul Tapponnier said “the place I’m worried about now is central Nepal.” Nepal’s median age is a youthful 22.9, and more than half the population is younger than 24. A majority of Nepalese were not alive for the 1988 earthquake, which before last week had been the country’s most recent major disaster. Nepalese residents with earthquake experience are vastly more concerned about damage than those without, according to a recent study. Presumably, this difference applies to perceived needs for preparedness as well. Good infrastructure enables disaster resilience, but informed perceptions and behaviors at both the individual and government levels are also critically important.
6069.txt:The death toll from the recent earthquake has already exceeded 6200. Preliminary estimates by the United States Geological Survey indicate the physical and economic damage may exceed Nepal’s $20 billion annual GDP. With the current lack of information, it is also unknown whether the hydropower dams near the earthquake’s epicenter have been affected. Nepal already suffers from an electricity crisis, and the problem may now worsen. The earthquake will likely delay the construction of a proposed $1.6 billion hydroelectric dam funded by the Chinese. There may even be reconsideration about the viability of such a large dam in a seismically active region. The anti-dam lobby, which vehemently opposes the development of any such structure, will very likely raise questions and perhaps even legal challenges. This will also delay the construction of other dams in Nepal, which in turn will constrain the availability of electricity necessary for socioeconomic development. Also, the cost of such projects may increase given new seismic concerns. Fortunately, knowledge and technology have advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the construction of large infrastructure in seismic zones. In the long-term, such projects are likely to be economically net-positive. Currently, however, this is a tough political sell.

6139.txt:Members of the relief team after their return from Nepal. Picture by Pranab Kumar Das Guwahati, May 12: An earthquake measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale at 12.35pm and the subsequent aftershocks led to panic and many here rushed out of their homes for safety - a behaviour that disaster management experts have said is not advisable during a tremor. "People living in multi-storeyed buildings should not come out during a quake. Those inside their homes or offices should stay inside, drop, cover or hold onto sturdy furniture to reduce damage. If they can't get under furniture, move to an archway and sit with your back to the wall, bring your knees to your chest and cover the head. People should remain inside till the shaking subsides," said Jayanta Pathak, a professor of Assam Engineering College's civil engineering department here at Jalukbari. It is surprising to see people still coming out of their homes during today's tremor though the disaster management department has been advising against it to reduce damage during an earthquake, he wondered. Pathak, however, said those living in single-storeyed house could come out carefully. Men, women and children were seen taking the stairs and coming out of their buildings here, though the awareness campaigns through of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) advised people to remain indoors during an earthquake. "If the tremors are severe and they detect any crack on the walls, they should call an engineer to check the severity of the damage," Pathak said. Although people remained tense, the authority said no report of damage because of today's earthquake was reported so far. "We checked with our district disaster management control rooms but no such damage has been reported so far. But we have asked the deputy commissioner of Kamrup (metro) district to carry out a survey to find out if there is any damage during today's earthquake," ASDMA chief executive officer P.K. Tiwari told The Telegraph. "There is no such damage but we will carry out an assessment," Kamrup (metro) deputy commissioner M. Angamuthu said. In the evening, a thunder squall with wind speed exceeding 60km per hour, hit the city today. The department had also issued a warning about occurrence of heavy rain at isolated places over Assam and Meghalaya today and Wednesday. A thunder squall with wind speed exceeding 60km per hour was also predicted at isolated places over Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Nagaland, Mizoram and Tripura yesterday and today. However, the weather department said this thunder squall had no relation with the earthquake that shook the city today. "Occurrence of thunder squalls is a normal phenomenon during March, April and May in the northeastern region. The thunder squall was a local development that had occurred over Dhubri and then moved towards Guwahati. It has no relation with the earthquake that occurred during the day. There is probability of a storm occurring in isolated places of the northeastern states. In Meghalaya, a thunder squall has already occurred in Tura today," said an official of the Regional Meteorological Centre here at Borjhar. The army's medical relief team, which was sent to Nepal for medical aid to the quake victims, returned to Tezpur last evening after successfully completing its mission. Three teams from Indian Army Medical Corps were dispatched to Nepal on April 26. Lt Col Sombit Ghosh, the defence spokesperson based in Tezpur, said the teams included 4004 field hospital, 4 Corps, Tezpur, 4033 field hospital, 33 Corps, Sukhna, and 60 Parachute field hospital, Agra. "Each army team comprised 10 doctors, including a surgeon, orthopaedic, medical specialist and an anaesthetist and Col Alok D. Sen, commanding officer of 4004 field hospital, was designated as the team leader," he said. Additional reporting by Pranab Kumar Das & Barnali Handique

6164.txt:KANPUR: A team of IIT-Kanpur experts and students returned to the city on Sunday after a week-long trip of quake-hit areas in Nepal and in UP and Bihar. Headed by earthquake engineer at IIT-K Prof Durgesh Rai, the team studied the devastation in the Himalayan nation.Besides Prof Rai, other team members were Vaibhav Singhal and research students Bhushan Raj and Lalit Sagar. They undertook a reconnaissance survey of the earthquake affected regions. Prof Rai and Vaibhav informed that they started their trip from Kanpur and went to Lucknow, Faizabad, Basti, Gonda, Gorakhpur and then went to north Bihar districts like Sitamarhi, Madhubani and headed to different regions in Nepal to study the affects of the quake."The magnitude 7.9 earthquake of April 25 had badly affected regions in Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Nuwakot, Sindhupalchok, Dhading and Gorkha," said Prof Rai. He said the old masonry in Nepal suffered the worst damage. Also buildings made on thin pillars suffered damage. He said that it was perplexing that a majority of buildings lacked earthquake resistant features.Prof Rao said that in old town of Bhaktapur, several unreinforced masonry buildings which were still used as residential structures had suffered maximum damage. The general damage to buildings and other structures went well with the intensity of ground shaking observed at various places, with the maximum of IX at Kathmandu, VIII at Bhaktapur and Lalitpur and VI in and around Sitamarhi in Bihar.He said historic buildings suffered varying degrees of damage and temples and heritage structures which survived need to be safeguarded against future tremors. Prof Rai, who is also the coordinator of National Information Centre for Earth Engineering (NICEE), IIT Kanpur, said: "The current event provides an opportunity to assess the existing seismic risk in the adjoining Indian regions which fall in the highest seismic zone V and the next severe zone IV in the event of a large Himalayan earthquake."
6171.txt:Americans and Nepalis are searching for the Marine helicopter that lost contact Tuesday evening near Charikot, an area roughly 45 miles east of Kathmandu, the capital, Pentagon officials said. The UH-1 Huey helicopter had six U.S. Marines and two Nepalis aboard at the time, Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said. Radio transmissions indicated its crew was having some type of fuel problem before it went missing, said Warren, who added the U.S. government is “hopeful” the aircraft didn’t crash but doesn’t know. The aircraft was assisting with disaster relief in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake that struck the Himalayan nation on April 25, killing thousands of people. Another strong earthquake hit Nepal on Tuesday afternoon, causing more damage and casualties. Nepali soldiers and police searched on foot through the night for the missing helicopter, said Prem Lal Lamichane, a senior official in Dolakha district. Two U.S. helicopters from the same squadron as the missing aircraft set out Wednesday morning to conduct aerial searches, according to the U.S. military. The helicopter that went missing had been “delivering humanitarian aid to those affected by the recent earthquake and evacuating casualties back to Kathmandu,” the U.S. military said. About 300 American personnel are on the ground in Nepal helping with earthquake relief efforts.

Houses and schools and buildings that were spared in the first one were probably affected yesterday. Roads, we know, have been damaged," he said."It is extremely urgent that the donors realise that we are running against the monsoon that is coming."The Nepal army mounted a huge ground and air search for a US Marine Corps helicopter that went missing on Tuesday during a disaster relief operation in the eastern district of Dolakha, near where the latest quake hit.Spokesman Jagdish Pokharel said the army would keep searching until it found the chopper, which was carrying six US Marines and two Nepal army soldiers when it disappeared in a remote mountainous area."We have been searching for the missing helicopter since early morning but have not found it yet," he said."They came to help us here... (and) we will continue to search for them."Police said 76 people had been confirmed dead and more than 2,000 injured in the new quake, which was centred 76 kilometres (47 miles) east of Kathmandu, and also killed 17 people in northern India."We had been focusing on relief distribution, but from yesterday our resources were deployed for rescue operations again," said Laxmi Prasad Dhakal, spokesman for the Nepal home ministry.Dolakha and Sindhupalchowk, two of the districts worst affected by the original quake, bore the brunt of the damage caused by the fresh tremors.The wounded -- many of them elderly -- continued to arrive Wednesday at a Norwegian Red Cross field hospital in Chautara in Sindhupalchowk, where shops remained closed and the streets empty of people.Nurse Rannvig Anderson said the first patient had arrived at the hospital just 10 minutes after the quake, and staff had had no respite since."People have no hope left," 62-year-old shopkeeper Ripunath Nepal told AFP in Chautara.

6209.txt:Dr Ellis said: “People have been so generous to our charity, which is small without deep pockets, but there is so much more that needs to be done and it has been made far worse by the second earthquake which we believe has caused similar damage to the first.”
6211.txt:An unconvincing and unauthoritative barrier of stones and wires are tangled around a thick bamboo pole lying across part of the road. Rita steps over them boldly. So Sukanya and I follow, leaving a cluster of men among onlookers we’ll pass along the next 200 meters staring at the devastation across the street. A crushed taxi is motionless by the curb and heaps of bricks flank the cleared path we now enter. Frankly I’m ready to turn back, but Rita has her assignment. Confidently she points out corner pillars—“there, up, up further, through that passage there—see, see those cracks at the base, see up the walls, this building, that one too.” Open windows expose limp curtains protecting nothing inside. No posting is needed to tell us all of them are vacant, and although these facades show little evidence of damage beyond those menacing cracks, all these four-story structures are either condemned (red code) or dangerous (orange). Don’t go further, says one bystander. But Rita presses on.

6214.txt:London: Britain said it was negotiating with the Nepalese authorities after three British military helicopters sent to help the earthquake relief effort were denied entry because of fears they could damage buildings while landing.
6214.txt:The Nepalese foreign ministry said the Chinook helicopters were too big and might damage houses when taking off and landing.
6214.txt:"We have told the British authorities that they cannot fly their Chinook helicopters here because our technical team says they are likely to damage the houses and other buildings in the Kathmandu Valley," a ministry spokesman was quoted as saying.
6214.txt:A British government spokesman said the Chinooks were chosen to minimise any risk of damage to buildings and had been sent after UN agencies indicated that extra helicopters were needed to deliver aid to remote areas inaccessible by road.
6214.txt:Aid agencies said damage caused by the new quake would make it even more difficult to reach remote areas devastated by last month's quake, slowing efforts to get aid to millions of people.
6214.txt:The RAF had planned to transport the helicopters to Kathmandu for reassembly, but they were diverted to India because of runway damage at Nepal's only international airport, according to The Times.

The surgical team is on their way to Ghorka to set up and begin responding to surgical needs ine area.
6217.txt:From first aerial assessments, the damage seems to be quite significant in a number of villages in the mountainous region. Due to the destruction, there is a need for relief items such as shelter, hygiene materials and cooking equipment.
6217.txt:An MSF team did an aerial assessment by helicopter of areas to the east, north and west of Kathmandu. Of approximately 65 villages viewed, around 45 had visible damage or were destroyed. These areas are isolated and only accessible by helicopter. One village, Warpak, has suffered extensive damage and the team plans to respond there. Teams arrived by road from Bihar (India) into Ghorka The town itself has not suffered damage.
6217.txt:One 17-member team is in Kathmandu. They have carried out an initial assessment of the damage by helicopter.

6252.txt:The next morning, Rob was able to assess the damage, heading to Durbar Square where he’d been before when he first came to Kathmandu. “I’d wandered through and taken a few photos, in true tourist fashion, never expecting to see it four weeks later in the state it was. Around half of the 20-something temples were either damaged or completely destroyed. The square is a popular meeting place for people, to socialise and sit on the steps of the temples. When they fell, people were instantaneously buried with no chance of escape.”
6254.txt:It can be argued that the scale of damage has left Nepal's government overwhelmed -- as it would any government -- but the lack of direction and leadership is baffling. On his flight to Kathmandu, the Hanoi-based entrepreneur ran into what was the first Indonesian team flying in to help with search and rescue. Their points of contact were a university professor and a mosque, as the team failed to find out which government agency to contact.
6259.txt:Rescuers battled Wednesday to reach survivors of a deadly new earthquake in Nepal that triggered landslides and brought down buildings, as the search resumed for a US military helicopter that went missing while delivering aid.Thousands of traumatised survivors spent the night outdoors, afraid to return to their houses after the 7.3-magnitude quake, which killed dozens of people and hit less than three weeks after the country was devastated by its deadliest quake in more than 80 years.The latest disaster took the overall death toll to more than 8,200 people, and has compounded the already monumental challenge of reaching far-flung mountain communities in desperate need of shelter, food and clean water.The Nepal army resumed its aerial search for a US Marine Corps helicopter that went missing during a disaster relief operation in eastern Nepal, near where the latest quake hit.The Pentagon has said there may have been a problem with fuel on the chopper, which was carrying six US Marines and two Nepal army soldiers when it disappeared."We have been informed that an American helicopter has gone missing, search operations have begun," said Laxmi Prasad Dhakal, spokesman for the Nepal home ministry.Dhakal said 65 people had been confirmed dead so far in the latest quake, which was centred 76 kilometres (47 miles) east of Kathmandu, and also killed 17 people in northern India."We had been focusing on relief distribution, but from yesterday our resources were deployed for rescue operations again," he said.Tuesday's quake was felt as far away as New Delhi, and caused buildings to collapse in Tibet in neighbouring China, killing at least one person there.A second tremor of 6.3-magnitude struck Nepal around half an hour later, followed by yet more aftershocks, according to the USGS.Two large buildings damaged in the 7.8-magnitude quake that hit on April 25 collapsed in Kathmandu Tuesday. But Dolakha and Sindhupalchowk, two of the districts worst affected by the original quake, bore the brunt of the damage caused by the fresh tremors."Many houses have collapsed in Dolakha... there is a chance that the number of dead from the district will go up," said Home Minister Bam Dev Gautam.The Red Cross said it had received reports of large-scale casualties in the town of Chautara in Sindhupalchowk, where its Norwegian branch is running a field hospital."Hundreds of people are pouring in. They are treating dozens for injuries and they have performed more than a dozen surgeries," said spokeswoman Nichola Jones.There were several reports of landslides in the worst-hit areas, making the task of getting relief to remote communities in the mountainous country even more difficult.Save the Children said the Gorkha region, near the epicentre of the April 25 quake, had also been hit by landslides and many key roads were blocked.Regine Kopplow, a German aid worker who was in the Dolakha district headquarters of Charikot when the latest quake hit, saw huge dust clouds rise into the air as buildings collapsed."I saw a woman in the building opposite jump from the third floor who suffered injuries to her leg, elbow and hand," said Kopplow, who works for Concern Worldwide."People stayed outside, the shaking continued. Some people were crying, hugging each other and sitting on the ground supporting each other."Many in Kathmandu had begun to return to their homes after weeks sleeping outdoors, but after Tuesday's strong tremors large numbers once again fled buildings to spend the night in tents or under tarpaulins.The Nepalese government has acknowledged that it was overwhelmed by the scale of the April 25 disaster, which destroyed nearly 300,000 homes and left many more too dangerous to live in."At an hour of a natural disaster like this, we have to face it with courage and patience," Nepal's Prime Minister Sushil Koirala said after an emergency meeting of his cabinet on Tuesday.Scientists said Tuesday's quake was part of a chain reaction set off by the larger one that struck on April 25 in Lamjung district west of Kathmandu."Large earthquakes are often followed by other quakes, sometimes as large as the initial one," said Carmen Solana, a volcanologist at Britain's University of Portsmouth."This is because the movement produced by the first quake adds extra stress on other faults and destabilises them," she told the London-based Science Media Centre.
6262.txt:Weber said there were a few houses that had fallen in the village but there wasn’t much more visible damage there.

6265.txt:KATHMANDU/PATNA: There was panic in Kathmandu, which bore the brunt of the massive April 25 earthquake, as people rushed out of their homes onto the streets. People held each other as they ran for safety, crying and making desperate calls to their near ones in Kathmandu. On many roads, people stopped their vehicles midway to run for cover.Fear gripped Nepal's Parliament too. Members fled as the Parliament building shook when Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist) representative Vishnu Poudel was speaking on the rehabilitation of the survivors of the earlier earthquake."It was very scary. The ground shook violently," Reena Shrestha told TOI. Her house at Teku in Kathmandu had developed cracks at many places on April 25. "This time the cracks have widened," she said. Her father-in-law, Janakman, who had survived the 1934 earthquake that was stronger than the last two ones, too, was out in the lawn."Most of the damage has taken place in Sindhupalchowk and Dolakha districts," said Laxmi Prasad Dhakal, Nepal's home ministry spokesperson. Kodari is located in Sindhupalchowk district, where the maximum deaths took place in last month's earthquake.Reports said houses and shops had collapsed in Charikot and Sunkhani (both in Dolakha district), Chautara (Sindhupalchowk district) and Salleri and Namche (both in Solokhumbhu district), which lies at the foot of Everest. Incidents of house and wall collapse were reported from Sallaghari in Bhaktapur, an ancient city 10km east of Kathmandu, Teku and Sitapaila in the Nepalese capital. The serial tremors triggered landslides at three places in Sindhupalchowk, through which the Araniko Rajmarg connecting Kathmandu with Tibet passes.Reports said the impact of the earthquake was felt in Tibet's Jilong and Zhangmu regions as well as Lhasa. In the April 25 earthquake, around 25 people had died on the Tibetan side of the border, where Chinese doctors had treated many injured Nepalese.After an emergency meeting, Nepal's Prime Minister Sushil Koirala told the media, "We must maintain our calm and face the disaster together." Home minister Bamdev Gautam added, "Twenty districts have been hit this time."
6267.txt:The 7.3 earthquake at 12.35 pm Tuesday was seen near Kodari which is on Nepal’s border with Tibet. This time the quake caused maximum damage in Dolakha and Sindhupalchowk districts, which are already remembering from aftershocks in the month of the April 25 tremor.

6309.txt:BERKELEY, Calif. (KTVU) -- Seismologists are analyzing two earthquakes that hit Nepal and Japan Tuesday, two regions already struggling to recover from the devastating damage and loss of life caused by previous quakes.The two earthquakes occurred about 10 hours apart Wednesday.The 7.3 magnitude quake at about 1 p.m. Wednesday shook the area northeast of Nepal's capital city of Kathmandu, near Mount Everest about 1 p.m. Wednesday. At least 17 strong aftershocks were recorded.By nightfall, officials said the quake killed at least 68 people in Nepal, India, and Tibet and injured more than 1,200 others. It rattled residents of Nepal who were already fearful after the 7.8 earthquake on April 25th that was centered northwest of Kathmandu and killed some 8,100 people.For the people in Nepal, the magnitude of the quakes is measured in the pain and fear, the lost lives, and the human toll."This was a jolt just like the big one last one, though it was not that long. I was very scared. I thought anything could happen to me." said Avinav Shrestha, a Bhaktapur resident, who spoke with media through a translator.For scientists, the latest earthquakes provide new insight, measured in data points, that could help them better understand the mysteries of the Earth's movements."So the earthquakes in Nepal are the result of plate tectonics. We have the Indian plate moving northward hitting the belly of Asia and subducting underneath," said Peggy Hellweg, a geophysicist with the UC Berkeley Seismological Laboratory."In fact, for this section of the world, magnitude 7.8 is not big," said Hellweg, "History shows us there have been magnitude 9's on the Himalayan front."She says the Nepal earthquake Wednesday might not have been an aftershock, but rather, a separate part of the plate that was subjected to added pressure following the April 25th Nepal quake."That's the kind of earthquake today's earthquake was. It wasn't in the region where the earthquake happened, it was off on the edge," Hellweg told KTVU.In Japan, at 6:13 a.m. Wednesday, an earthquake off the northeast coast of the main island of Honshu measured between 6.6 to 6.8 magnitude. It shook the same region devastated by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. By evening, there were no reports of damage to the Fukushima nuclear plant or any injuries in the area.Hellweg says in that case, the quake in Japan likely was an aftershock, coming four years after the massive 9.0 Tohoku 2011 quake."I would expect earthquakes to keep going for months, years, maybe even tens of years," Hellweg said.She says it is still unclear whether large quakes in one region can trigger major quakes in other places of the world, however, there can be lessons learned from Wednesday's quakes."There are new remote tools to be able to look at damage remotely, using satellite data for example and scanning that," Hellweg said.Another tool being developed, is an early warning system similar to one in Japan, that can detect quakes and then send a cell phone alert before people feel the quake. Professor Hellweg says just last week, their prototype was able to send an alert during a small quake in Southern California. Researchers at UC Berkeley are hoping to get more state and federal money to complete the project.

In fact, their deadly effect is mostly man-controlled, as a big part of the deaths come from buildings collapsing, killing, and burying victims. Just one week before the disaster, Hari Ghi's group Geohazards International made a full update on a report from the 90's describing the risks at the Kathmandu Valley. Among the worst, the rampant construction of homes and infrastructures with no earthquake-related security and the high concentration of population in danger zones were highlighted.

6337.txt:Reuters – Hundreds of Nepali troops were searching for a missing U.S. Marines helicopter with eight people on board on Wednesday, a day after the second powerful earthquake in less than three weeks killed scores and sent panicked residents into the street. The Himalayan nation is still reeling from a devastating quake measuring 7.8 last month that killed more than 8,000 people and injured close to 20,000. The U.S. helicopter was delivering aid in Dolakha, one of the hardest-hit areas from the April 25 quake, on Tuesday when it went missing with six Marines and two Nepali troops on board. The Marine Corps UH-1Y Huey helicopter lost radio contact after its crew was heard talking about fuel problems. Related Articles U.S. chopper hits U.S. Humvee 04/13/08 WikiLeaks founder solicited U.S. secrets 06/11/13 A Nepali military official said it appeared the helicopter might have come down in one of the rivers that snake through valleys in the district of Dolakha east of the capital, Kathmandu. Six other helicopters joined hundreds of ground troops in the search for the missing aircraft. "The info we have is that it is down in one of the rivers, but none of the choppers has seen it yet," Major Rajan Dahal, second-in-command of the Barda Bahadur Battalion, told Reuters in the district capital, Charikot. "There are 400-plus of our ground troops looking for it also. By this evening, we might get it," he said. Nepal Home Ministry official Laxmi Prasad Dhal said no trace of the missing helicopter had been found but she feared the search was diverting resources from relief and rescue work. "The work of sending relief and rescuing the injured people to hospitals has been delayed due to this," she told Reuters. Tuesday's 7.3 quake killed 67 people and destroyed swaths of housing in the area. Charikot, about 75 km (45 miles) east of Kathmandu, was one of the hardest-hit areas. Most of the fatalities reported from Tuesday's quake were in towns and villages like Charikot, which were only just beginning to pick up the pieces from last month's quake. Tuesday's quake and subsequent aftershocks forced many panic-stricken Nepalis to spend yet another night outdoors in makeshift tents and relief camps. Aula Bahadur Ale, the assistant administrator of the district, said there were 36 dead in Charikot and surrounding areas and 106 injured. "It looks like a graveyard here," Ale said. "Even those houses that have not been flattened have developed cracks. People are too afraid to go into them. We are still feeling the aftershocks that make people terrified." A police official in Kathmandu said 1,928 people had been injured in Tuesday's quake, which also killed 17 people in neighboring India. The April quake destroyed hundreds of thousands of buildings, including many ancient temples, and triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest that killed 18 climbers and cut short the climbing season on the world's tallest peak. The tremors have left areas of Nepal perilously unstable, leading to fears of more landslides, especially when seasonal monsoon rains begin to fall in the coming weeks. In Kathmandu, most open spaces such as private land and pavements were occupied by residents who set up yellow, blue and white tarpaulin sheets. Kathmandu resident Sita Gurung said her newly built house had escaped damage but she still did not want to go back. "How can I take risk and stay in? Every one has come out and is living in the open," Gurung said. "I better join them and stay safe." While you were sleeping, this also happened

"This time we were kind of on edge and kind of expecting it, so we did the right thing and we stood in the doorway and we patiently waited."Tomlinson says it felt like the quake lasted 30 to 40 seconds, but it was still very damaging for a community trying to recover from the last earthquake."Since the last earthquake we've been seeing a ton of damage, but I took my motorbike out since this afternoon and we saw fresh damage," he said. "New houses are down, everybody's in the streets right now, frightened."Tomlinson has been in Nepal for about five months, living in a district south of Kathmandu, doing HR work with the Umbrella Foundation -- an organization that works against corrupt orphanages and helps human-trafficking victims.In the last few weeks, he's turning his efforts towards earthquake recovery and he's turning towards the Internet."(We are) helping (with) medical expenses, we are building houses, we are paying rent until people heal," said Tomlinson.Tomlinson even made a Go Fund Me page, and has currently raised more than $11,000."Money goes so far," he said.

Dhakal said the Sindhupalchowk and Dolakha districts were the hardest hit.Rescuers fanned out to search for survivors in Sindhulpalchowk's town of Chautara, where several buildings collapsed. Chautara has become a hub for humanitarian aid after the magnitude-7.8 quake on April 25 killed more than 8,150 people and injured more than 17,860 as it flattened mountain villages and destroyed buildings. It was Nepal's worst recorded earthquake since 1934.Tuesday's quake was deeper, however, coming from a depth of 18.5 kilometers (11.5 miles) versus the earlier one at 15 kilometers (9.3 miles). Shallow earthquakes tend to cause more damage.The Tuesday quake was followed closely by at least six strong aftershocks, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.The international airport in Kathmandu, which has become a transport hub for international aid, was closed briefly after Tuesday's quake, while traffic snarled in the streets of the capital.Early reports indicated at least two buildings had collapsed in Kathmandu, though at least one had been unoccupied due to damage it sustained during the April 25 quake. Experts say the April 25 quake caused extensive structural damage even in buildings that did not topple, and that many could be in danger of future collapse."The shaking seemed to go on and on," Rose Foley, a UNICEF official based in Kathmandu, said after the latest quake. "It felt like being on a boat in rough seas."Aid agencies were struggling to get reports from outside of the capital."We're thinking about children across the country, and who are already suffering. This could make them even more vulnerable," Foley said.Residents of the small town of Namche Bazaar, about 50 kilometers (35 miles) from the epicenter of the latest quake and a well-known spot for high-altitude trekkers, said a couple of buildings damaged in the earlier earthquake collapsed Tuesday. However, there were no reports of deaths or injuries in the town.Meanwhile, new landslides blocked mountain roads in the district of Gorkha, one of the most damaged regions after the April 25 quake."People are terribly scared. Everyone ran out in the streets because they are afraid of being inside the houses," Norwegian Red Cross Secretary-General Asne Havnelid told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.-At Kathmandu's Norvic Hospital, patients and doctors rushed to the parking lot."I thought I was going to die this time," said Sulav Singh, who rushed with his daughter into a street in the suburban neighborhood of Thapathali. "Things were just getting back to normal, and we get this one."Nepalese have been terrified by dozens of aftershocks that followed the April 25 quake. The impoverished country has appealed for billions of dollars in aid from foreign nations, as well as medical experts to treat the wounded and helicopters to ferry food and temporary shelters to hundreds of thousands left homeless amid unseasonal rains.Paul Dillon, a spokesman with the International Organization for Migration, said he saw a man in Kathmandu who had apparently run from the shower with shampoo covering his head. "He was sitting on the ground, crying," Dillon said.Across the Nepalese border in Tibet's Jilong and Zhangmu regions, the earth shook strongly. Tremors were also felt slightly in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa."Rocks fell from the mountains," Jilong county government vice chief Wang Wenxiang was quoted as saying by China News Service.

6480.txt:The magnitude-7.3 quake -- centered midway between the capital of Kathmandu and Mount Everest -- hit hardest in districts northeast of the capital. It terrified a nation already shell-shocked and struggling after a more powerful quake on April 25 killed more than 8,150 and flattened entire villages, leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.Information was slow to reach Kathmandu after Tuesday's quake, but officials expected the death toll to rise as reports arrived of people being buried under rubble, according to the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.Nepal's Home Ministry reported at least 42 deaths but later lowered the toll to 37. Meanwhile, it said at least 1,139 people had been injured in Nepal. In neighboring India, at least 16 people were confirmed dead after rooftops or walls collapsed onto them, according to India's Home Ministry. Chinese media reported one death in Tibet.In Nepal, at least three people had been rescued in the capital, while another nine pulled to safety in the district of Dolkha, the government said.Rescue helicopters were sent to mountain districts where landslides and collapsed buildings may have buried people, the government said. Home Ministry official Laxmi Dhakal said the Sindhupalchowk and Dolkha districts were the worst hit.Search parties fanned out to look for survivors in the wreckage of collapsed buildings in Sindhulpalchowk's town of Chautara, which had become a hub for humanitarian aid after the magnitude-7.8 earthquake on April 25, Nepal's worst-recorded quake since 1934.Nepal was left reeling by the April 25 quake. The impoverished country appealed for billions of dollars in aid from foreign nations, as well as medical experts to treat the wounded and helicopters to ferry food and temporary shelters to hundreds of thousands left homeless amid unseasonal rains.Tuesday's quake was deeper, however, coming from a depth of 18.5 kilometers (11.5 miles) versus the earlier one at 15 kilometers (9.3 miles). Shallow earthquakes tend to cause more damage.The Tuesday quake was followed closely by at least 10 strong aftershocks, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.Early reports indicated at least two buildings had collapsed in Kathmandu, though at least one had been unoccupied due to damage it sustained during the April 25 quake. Experts say the April 25 quake caused extensive structural damage even in buildings that did not topple, and that many could be in danger of future collapse.Frightened residents in the capital, who had returned to their homes only a few days ago, were once again setting up tents outdoors Tuesday night with plans to sleep in empty fields, parking lots and on sidewalks.“Everyone was saying the earthquakes are over ... Now I don't want to believe anyone,'' said 40-year-old produce vendor Ram Hari Sah as he searched for a spot to pitch the orange tarpaulin his family would shelter in. ``We are all scared, we are terrified. I would rather deal with mosquitoes and the rain than sleep in the house.''Extra police officers were sent to patrol ad-hoc camping areas, while drinking water and extra tents were being provided, according to Kathmandu administrator Ek Narayan Aryal.“I thought I was going to die this time,'' said Sulav Singh, who rushed with his daughter into a street in the suburban neighborhood of Thapathali. ``Things were just getting back to normal, and we get this one.''Paul Dillon, a spokesman with the International Organization for Migration, said he saw a man in Kathmandu who had apparently run from the shower with shampoo covering his head. ``He was sitting on the ground, crying,'' Dillon said.Meanwhile, new landslides blocked mountain roads in the district of Gorkha, one of the regions most damaged by the April 25 quake, while previously damaged buildings collapsed with the latest quake.Residents of the small town of Namche Bazaar, about 50 kilometers (35 miles) from the epicenter of Tuesday's quake and a well-known spot for high-altitude trekkers, said a couple of buildings damaged in the earlier earthquake had collapsed there as well. However, there were no reports of deaths or injuries in the town.The earth also shook strongly across the border in Tibet, unleashing a landslide that killed one person and injured three, according to China's state broadcaster China Central Television. Two houses also collapsed, CCTV said, quoting disaster relief headquarters of the regional Tibetan government. (AP)

6483.txt:LONDON, May 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Britain said on Tuesday it was negotiating with the Nepalese authorities after three British military helicopters sent to help the earthquake relief effort were denied entry because of fears they could damage buildings while landing.
6483.txt:The Nepalese foreign ministry said the Chinook helicopters were too big and might damage houses when taking off and landing.

6487.txt:RAF HELICOPTERS SENT TO HELP EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS ARE BARRED FROM ENTERING NEPAL Nepal has denied entry to three British Chinook helicopters sent to aid the earthquake effort - amid fears they could damage buildings when landing. The RAF aircraft arrived in New Delhi, India last week ahead of plans to fly them across the border and join the international rescue operation. But the Nepalese foreign ministry has refused permission for them to enter the quake-hit country with a spokesman suggesting they are too big to land near houses. The spokesman, Tara Pokharel, added: 'We have told the British authorities that they cannot fly their Chinook helicopters here because our technical team says they are likely to damage the houses and other buildings in the Kathmandu valley. 'We are worried about broken windows and roofs being blown off by these big helicopters.' It comes as a second major earthquake hit an isolated area of Nepal today near the Chinese border between the capital, Kathmandu, and Mount Everest. Britain flew the helicopters out from RAF Brize Norton in transporter aircraft on April 30. According to the Times, the RAF had planned to transport the helicopters to Kathmandu for reassembly - but when it became clear Nepal's only international airport was too damaged, they were diverted to India. The 7.8 magnitude earthquake on April 25 killed more than 8,000 people and left thousands more homeless and in desperate need of food, clean water and shelter. Getting relief to the worst-hit villages is a huge challenge because many are in remote mountainous terrain that is only accessible by helicopter or on foot. India, China and the United States have sent helicopters and are helping take food, water and tents to affected communities.

6610.txt:(Left)A crack on the outer surface of the Shahid Minar after the earthquake on Tuesday afternoon. (Right) A damaged wall of Block B at Writersâ Buildings, which is to be demolished as part of the renovation project (Amit Datta) The temblor on Tuesday has inflicted more damage on Calcutta than the stronger one on April 25 that left Nepal devastated. Engineers reported cracks on two iconic structures, Writers' Buildings and the Shahid Minar, after the 12.36pm earthquake that was followed by an aftershock at 1.06pm. Officials of the public works department said a hairline crack that had appeared on a pillar of the Shahid Minar on April 25 was found to have "widened significantly" following Tuesday's jolt. A second crack was noticed on the outer surface of the monument that is part of the heritage zone in the heart of the city. At Writers', cracks appeared on a pillar on the top floor of Block B, opposite the Calcutta Stock Exchange. A second crack was spotted on a wall of the same block. The top floor used to house the office of the agriculture department before it was shifted to Jessop Building. "The cracks in both the structures are signs of structural damage... As far as the Shahid Minar is concerned, immediate renovation would be taken up. At Writers', the entire block is to be demolished anyway as part of the ongoing renovation," a PWD engineer said. Designed by Thomas Lyon in 1777, Writers' Buildings has added several blocks over the decades. According to senior government officials, Block B came up after Independence. The renovation of Writers' started in October 2013 and the state secretariat shifted to Nabanna, across the Hooghly. The project had been long overdue, especially in the light of warnings from engineers that Bengal's seat of power had turned into a tinderbox because of blocks being added to the main structure post-Independence. The inspection report also mentioned that the superstructure had become vulnerable to earthquakes because of additional load being put on it in the form of extensions. "It is now clear that the decision to renovate Writers' Buildings was the right one.... Had there been offices at Writers' now, the earthquake-inflicted damage to the structure might have been severe because more the number of offices, greater the load," an expert in structural safety said. According to the renovation plan, finalised during a recent meeting chaired by home secretary Basudeb Banerjee, all blocks added to the structure post-1945 will be pulled down. "It means blocks A, B, C, D, E, F, G and CGA are to be demolished. This will help the structure shed the extra load put on it in the name of creating more office space," a senior government official said. While nothing extra needs to be done at Writers' as of now, the PWD is worried about the hairline crack on a pillar of the Shahid Minar. "This pillar is crucial to the stability of the staircase within the 48-metre-tall structure. This is seen to be considerable structural damage and we have to renovate it at the earliest. A report has already been prepared and renovation will be taken up soon," the official said. The monument, built in 1828 in memory of Major General Sir David Ochterlony, commander of the British East India Company, had undergone renovation in 2012. Entry into the Shahid Minar was restricted after a tourist jumped from the top in 1997. Since 2012, when the last round of renovation was carried out, nobody is allowed inside. One of the keys to the interior of the structure is with the PWD and the other with Lalbazar, the city police headquarters. "We visited the structure after Tuesday's tremor and found that the crack that had developed during the April 25 earthquake had grown wider. A fresh crack has appeared on the outer wall and that is cause for concern. We have sent a report to the government," said an engineer in the inspection team. There had been rumours of damage to several vital installations in Calcutta after the earthquake last month, prompting the PWD to carry out a series of inspections. At Nabanna, Tuesday's tremor did not cause any harm except causing panic as the 15-storey building swayed for several seconds. Finance minister Amit Mitra and agriculture minister Purnendu Basu were among the first to exit their offices on the 12th and 3rd floors respectively. Senior officials followed suit and stayed put in the courtyard for nearly 40 minutes after the earthquake, which measured 7.3 on the Richter scale at its epicentre in Nepal.
6613.txt:▲ Bags of rice were among the items on sale to raise funds. Photo by Yoki Photography All photos by Yoki Photography ▲ Teas and yoghurt drinks were among the most popular on the day. Photo by Yoki Photography The Jeju community held a food and market fundraising event on Sunday, May 10, to raise money for victims of the Nepal earthquake. The April disaster left at least 8,000 dead and 18,000 injured. The UN says more than 8 million people have been affected with hundreds of thousands homeless. There are around 1,100 Nepalis living on Jeju and 47 have reported damage to property or injury to family members, while others have reported bereavements (although exact figures are not available). The Nepal Community, Jeju Migrant Peace Community and Jeju Multicultural Family Center thus joined forces to raise funds for the relief effort. A vigil and awareness-raising event was first held at Jeju City Hall on Sunday, May 3, before a larger food and market event was held at the nearby Cool Hof on Sunday, May 10. There were sales of rice, handicrafts, clothes and Korean and Nepali foods as the Cool Hof owner donated use of the premises for the day. All proceeds from sales went toward the relief fund. ▲ Photo by Yoki Photography Normally quiet on a Sunday afternoon, smiling faces from the mountainous country between China and India greeted visitors as the bar thronged with families from all over the world. As children scurried around the room and the unmistakable scent of of curry filled the air, Subhadra Palungwa, representative of the Jeju Nepal community and interpreter for Jeju Multicultural Family Center, expressed her happiness at the impressive turnout in support the Nepali people. “Because there are lots of Nepali people on Jeju, there are lots of people who have suffered [earthquake] damage. So we asked the Jeju people to help us through promotions on TV, newspapers and other media,” she said. ▲ Many families joined the event for lunch. Photo by Yoki Photography Subhadra said it was a sign of the good relationship between the two communities and added that there are other non-emergency fundraising events throughout the year, and she had personally visited to donate school uniforms, bags and rice to an orphanage in the past. ▲ Nepal community representative Subhadra Palungwa. Photo by Yoki Photography “We have a great relationship with the Korean community. Both the Jeju Migrant Peace Community and Jeju Multicultural Family Center work well together to help the Nepali people.” A decision on how to use the funds raised will be made after consulting with the damaged communities. Essential items and materials will be supplied directly to Nepal while other funds will be sent through the Nepali Embassy in Seoul.

6658.txt:But Dolakha and Sindhupalchowk, two of the districts worst affected by the original quake, bore the brunt of the damage caused by the fresh tremors.
6658.txt:The head of the country's mountaineering association, Ang Tsering Sherpa, said many houses had collapsed and there were reports of damage to infrastructure in the eastern Khumbu region, where Mount Everest is located.
6660.txt:◆ Hub for Aid The quake Tuesday caused landslides around Chautara, and more than 100 people had been injured in surrounding villages, chief district officer Krishna Gyawali told The Associated Press. Paul Dillon, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, said a rescue team from the agency has begun searching through the wreckage at Chautara, which was heavily damaged in April's earthquake. Chautara had become a hub for humanitarian aid in the wake of the earlier quake. Tuesday's quake was deeper, however, coming from a depth of 18.5 km versus the April 25 quake that hit 15 km. More shallow earthquakes tend to cause more damage at the surface. In Kathmandu, the international airport, which has become a transport hub for international aid, was closed temporarily. Traffic snarled in the streets. The city lost power. Shops that had just reopened after last month's quake quickly closed. Telephone circuits were inundated. Television footage showed Nepal's parliament shake as the quake struck. The quake also sent people rushing outside their homes, where many remained hours later. ◆ 'A lot of Confusion' Aid worker Mulchand Dedhia said, "I think there is still a lot of confusion, people still are actually in a dilemma on what to do next. I think they are still going to be waiting here trying to figure out the next step. I am pretty sure people here are pretty shaken, so I don’t think they will be venturing anywhere inside at least for some more time." Officials gave no immediate estimates of damage. Strong shaking was also felt across northern India and Bangladesh. In the Indian capital of New Delhi, thousands of workers ran out of high rise buildings that were swaying. L.S. Rathore, head of the India Meteorological Department, said this quake was deeper than the one that struck in April. Deeper quakes generally cause less destructio n, but Rathore said Tuesday’s jolt had the potential to cause damage, because structures that have were weakened by the previous earthquake could become even more vulnerable after the latest one. Across the Nepalese border in Tibet's Jilong and Zhangmu regions, the Earth shook strongly. Tremors were also felt slightly in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa.
6662.txt:Last month's quake was only 15km deep and shallower earthquakes are more likely to cause more damage at the surface.

6671.txt:This earthquake is considered to be a shallow earthquake, having a depth of only 15 km (9.3 miles). Shallow earthquakes of this nature typically cause more damage than those of a similar magnitude at a greater depth.
6674.txt:This comes as the Nepali population struggles to recover from the loss of life and substantial damage that followed the earthquake of 25 April in which over 8,000 people died.
6675.txt:Tuesday's quake was deeper, from a depth of 11.5 miles with the earlier one at 9.3 miles, and was followed closely by at least 10 strong aftershocks, the U.S. Geological Survey said. Shallow earthquakes tend to cause more damage.
6675.txt:Early reports indicated at least two buildings had collapsed in Kathmandu. At least one had been unoccupied after sustaining damage April 25. Experts say the earlier quake caused extensive structural damage in buildings that did not topple and that many could be in danger of collapse.

The impoverished country appealed for billions of pounds in aid from foreign nations, as well as medical experts to treat the wounded and helicopters to ferry food and temporary shelters to hundreds of thousands left homeless amid unseasonal rains. The new quake was deeper, coming from a depth of 11.5 miles, compared with the earlier one at 9.3 miles. Shallow earthquakes tend to cause more damage.

6694.txt:KATHMANDU/PATNA: Death and destruction revisited Nepal and Bihar on Tuesday when a powerful 7.3- magnitude earthquake violently shook the landmass on either side of Mount Everest, stretching to Lhasa isthe north and Dhaka in the south.It came 17 days after a 7.9-magnitude earthquake devastated large swathes of Nepal and parts of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the Himalayan nation's closest neighbours. Until now, 8,034 people have been reported dead as a result of the first temblor in Nepal, which has just begun rebuilding from the ruins.Preliminary reports said Tuesday's quake killed 57 people in Nepal while more than 1,100 were injured. The toll may go up, with massive devastation being reported from remote areas close to Tibet.In Patna, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar said, "We have received reports of the death of 15 people, six of which have been confirmed." Large-scale destruction has been reported from Darbhanga, Sitamarhi, East and West Champaran, Araria, Supaul, Sheohar, Purnia, Siwan and Patna.The US Geological Survey said the 7.3-earthquake, which shook Nepal at 12.50pm (local time) was epicentred at 18km from Kodari, a rural settlement close 80km east of Kathmandu and close to Tibet. There were at least five major aftershocks, one of which had its epicentre at Ramechhap, further east of Kodari.In Kathmandu, which bore the brunt of the April 25 earthquake, people rushed out of their homes into open spaces and streets. They held each other as they ran for safety, crying and making desperate calls to their near ones. On many roads, people stopped their vehicles midway to run for cover.Fear gripped Nepal's Parliament too. Members fled as the building shook when Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist) representative Vishnu Poudel was speaking on the rehabilitation of the survivors of the earlier earthquake."It was very scary. The ground shook violently," Reena Shrestha told TOI. Her house at Teku in Kathmandu had developed cracks at many places on April 25. "This time the cracks have widened," she said. Her father-in-law, Janakman, who had survived the 1934 earthquake that was stronger than the last two ones, too, was out in the lawn."Most of the damage has taken place in Sindhupalchowk and Dolakha districts," said Laxmi Prasad Dhakal, Nepal's home ministry spokesperson. Kodari is located in Sindhupalchowk , where the maximum deaths took place in last month's earthquake.Reports said houses and shops had collapsed in Charikot and Sunkhani (both in Dolakha ), Chautara (Sindhupalchowk ) and Salleri and Namche (Solokhumbhu district), which lies at the foot of Everest. Incidents of house and wall collapse were reported from Sallaghari in Bhaktapur, an ancient city 10km east of Kathmandu, Teku and Sitapaila in the Nepalese capital. The serial tremors triggered landslides at three places in Sindhupalchowk, through which the Araniko Rajmarg connecting Kathmandu with Tibet passes.Reports said the impact of the earthquake was felt in Tibet's Jilong and Zhangmu regions as well as Lhasa. In the April 25 earthquake, around 25 people had died on the Tibetan side of the border, where Chinese doctors had treated many injured Nepalese.After an emergency meeting, Nepal's Prime Minister Sushil Koirala told the media, "We must maintain our calm and face the disaster together." Home minister Bamdev Gautam added, "Twenty districts have been hit this time."

Although there have been no loss of human lives, a dilapidated water tank in Etamad-ud-Daula area collapsed and a few buildings in the older part of the city reportedly developed cracks.Almost half-a-dozen aftershocks which were felt in the city between 11.45am and 3.30pm also resulted in a cement canopy come crashing down on a vehicle parked in the S N Medical College premises.Taj Mahal bore the brunt of the quake as well, but no damage was reported as a result. Other heritage sites in and around the city remained unscathed as well, according to the local administration.Although there were rumours being circulated on WhatsApp about deaths of people in the city, district magistrate Pankaj Kumar downplayed such speculation, saying: "I assure our people that no human loss has been reported in Agra. We request citizens to remain calm and ignore misinformation being peddled by unverified sources."Terrified by the endless aftershocks that hit the city, locals huddled in groups. Panicked residents rushed out out, pouring out from residential high-rises, hotels and hospitals.Standing outside S N Medical College with his septuagenarian paralytic father, Santosh Raguram said, "The entire building of the hospital began shaking around 11.45am. Medical equipments and the bed in which my father was lying began swaying. We felt dizzy for nearly 15 minutes after the incident."Shelja Mishra, working for a private bank in Sanjay Place, also narrated a similar story. "We rushed out of our office building and huddled in the parking lot. We saw buildings moving like a pendulum. Fortunately, no one was injured but many of them felt nauseous after the tremors," she said.Traffic also came to a standstill as people emerged from their houses to escape the quake.

6783.txt:Those roads have been blocked again since the earthquake, as rocks tumbled down the hills. With no access to roads, villagers in Laprak didn’t get help for days until the government started flying helicopters, first to survey the damage, and later to drop relief supplies. But for almost two weeks after the killer quake, villagers here did not see a single grain of rice. In the hours after the earthquake, villagers gathered whatever they could — aluminum pots, ladles, jute ropes — on a doko, a V-shaped basket woven from dry bamboo shoots, and walked, many of them barefoot, for two hours until they reached Gupsi Dada, one of the higher hills that hadn’t cracked from the earthquake. Shurman and Pasmaya, whose daughter Churkela had died in the quake, went to look for her body after the aftershocks had subsided on April 28. They found her and tied her to a flat plank of wood and carried it to one of two graveyards in the village. After burying their daughter, they walked up to Gupsi Dada with rest of the villagers. Their one-bedroom home was now unlivable and the upper floor bhakari where they stored maize and wheat was smashed into rubble, all of the food now useless. Among their smashed possessions were pots and pans, and a dingy aluminum steamer, which Churkela had used to cook momos, a traditional Nepali dumpling made with spices and minced meat. “She made really good fried potatoes and very delicious momos,” Shurman recalled. “She said she wanted to run a momo restaurant one day.” With little available to eat now, the only thing Churkela’s parents could do was think about their daughter’s food. The government had doled out a ration of six packets of noodles and five packets of biscuits. “We need blankets,” Shurman said. “It’s cold and it is going to rain soon.” Villagers run up to the helipad whenever a helicopter lands, expecting to receive something, anything. Not everyone, however, is joyous about the rice. “I don’t feel like eating,” said Dambar Bahadur, whose eyes have been swollen from crying since the day he saw his daughter’s bloodied body in the debris. During the decade-long armed conflict between Maoist guerrillas and Nepal’s army from 1996 to 2006, Dambar Bahadur would walk for five days to the bazaar in Gorkha to buy food for his family. That morning, he hardly wanted to think about it. He wiped his tears with his cracked, dry palms and stared at his wife. Rivulets of tears ran down her face. He said, “How do we cook this rice if we don’t have our daughter to bring us firewood?”

Gorkha, Dhading, Lamjung, Sindhupalchowk and parts of Bharatpur, Patan and Kathmandu have been razed to the ground. Rescue and relief efforts have been undermined due to severe damage to the infrastructure and the few all-weather roads.

6849.txt:: Rescuers battled on Wednesday to reach survivors of a deadly new earthquake in Nepal that triggered landslides and brought down buildings, as hundreds of troops searched for a missing US military helicopter.Thousands of traumatised survivors spent the night outdoors, afraid to return to their houses after Tuesday's 7.3-magnitude quake hit, less than three weeks after the country was devastated by its deadliest quake in more than 80 years.Dozens of people were killed in the latest disaster, bringing the overall death toll to more than 8,200 and compounding the difficulty of reaching far-flung mountain communities in desperate need of shelter, food and clean water.The United Nations said it faced a "monumental challenge" to bring relief to victims, many of whom live in areas accessible only on foot or by helicopter, before the monsoon rains began.UN resident coordinator Jamie McGoldrick said Tuesday's quake had exacerbated an already desperate situation as he delivered an urgent call for more funding."Damaged houses will be further damaged. Houses and schools and buildings that were spared in the first one were probably affected yesterday. Roads, we know, have been damaged," he said. "It is extremely urgent that the donors realise that we are running against the monsoon that is coming."The Nepal army mounted a huge ground and air search for a US Marine Corps helicopter that went missing on Tuesday during a disaster relief operation in the eastern district of Dolakha, near where the latest quake hit.Spokesman Jagdish Pokharel said the army would keep searching until it found the chopper, which was carrying six US Marines and two Nepal army soldiers when it disappeared in a remote mountainous area."We have been searching for the missing helicopter since early morning but have not found it yet," he said. "They came to help us here ... (and) we will continue to search for them."Police said 76 people had been confirmed dead and more than 2,000 injured in the new quake, which was centred 76 kilometres east of Kathmandu, and also killed 17 people in northern India."We had been focusing on relief distribution, but from yesterday our resources were deployed for rescue operations again," said Laxmi Prasad Dhakal, spokesman for the Nepal home ministry.Dolakha and Sindhupalchowk, two of the districts worst affected by the original quake, bore the brunt of the damage caused by the fresh tremors.The wounded - many of them elderly - continued to arrive on Wednesday at a Norwegian Red Cross field hospital in Chautara in Sindhupalchowk, where shops remained closed and the streets empty of people.Nurse Rannvig Anderson said the first patient had arrived at the hospital just 10 minutes after the quake, and staff had had no respite since. "People have no hope left," 62-year-old shopkeeper Ripunath Nepal told AFP in Chautara. "We know that another quake is coming."The Nepalese government has acknowledged that it was overwhelmed by the scale of the Apr 25 disaster, which destroyed nearly 300,000 homes and left many more too dangerous to live in.Tuesday's quake was felt as far away as New Delhi, and caused buildings to collapse in Tibet in neighbouring China, killing at least one person there. A second tremor and more aftershocks also followed.There were several reports of landslides blocking roads in the worst-hit areas, making the task of getting relief to remote communities in the Himalayan country even more difficult."Although our personnel are already present in quake-hit areas, these blockages will make it difficult to transport relief materials," said police spokesman Kamal Singh Bam.Many in Kathmandu had begun to return to their homes after weeks sleeping outdoors, but after Tuesday's strong quake and tremors, large numbers once again spent the night under canvas."Yesterday's quake shook us all, I couldn't imagine sleeping in our house with the kids. But we haven't been able to sleep in the tents either," said Kabita Maharjan, a 38-year-old mother of two young children."It was shaking all night, how could we? My kids were terrified. Who knows what will happen now."Scientists said Tuesday's quake was part of a chain reaction set off by the larger one that struck on Apr 25 in Lamjung district west of Kathmandu."Large earthquakes are often followed by other quakes, sometimes as large as the initial one."This is because the movement produced by the first quake adds extra stress on other faults and destabilises them," said Carmen Solana, a volcanologist at Britain's University of Portsmouth to the London-based Science Media Centre.

6859.txt:KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) -- Thousands of people fearing aftershocks continued to sleep outdoors as authorities tried to reach survivors of Nepal's most recent earthquake cut off by blocked roads in isolated villages.There was a shortage of tarpaulin and tents in the Nepalese capital and elsewhere and people were even using cardboard boxes as their temporary shelter after this Himalayan nation suffered through its second major quake on Tuesday in less than three weeks."We have nowhere to go. This is our home for now. We had just moved back into our rented rooms and again the earthquakes are back," Raj Kumar, a carpenter who was sharing a small tent with two other families, said Thursday.A search also continued Thursday for a U.S. Marine Corps helicopter carrying six Marines and two Nepalese soldiers. It went missing Tuesday while delivering aid in the country's northeast, U.S. officials said. There have been no indications it crashed.The magnitude-7.3 earthquake shook the impoverished country Tuesday, killing at least 91 people and injuring more than 2,300, just as it was beginning to rebuild from a devastating April 25 earthquake."I just don't feel safe anymore. I get scared even when cars or trucks drive past us and the ground shakes. We are all terrified. Now I am afraid that we might all get sick staying out in the open space, cramped into these tents and not getting enough water," Srijana Sharma, a house wife, said in Kathmandu.The most recent quake hit hardest in deeply rural parts of the Himalayan foothills, hammering many villages reached only by hiking trails and causing road-blocking landslides."Damaged houses were further damaged or destroyed. Houses and schools building spared before were affected ... roads were damaged," said Jamie McGoldrick, a top U.N. official in Nepal.Among 14 quake-hit districts, some are barely accessible, and a large part of the affected population could not be reached easily because of damaged roads."Some are even difficult to reach by helicopter. We are facing monumental challenges here to support the government in these districts," McGoldrick said.On Wednesday, officials with bullhorns walked through the worst-damaged streets of Chautara, a small town northeast of Kathmandu, calling for people to leave buildings in danger of collapsing after Tuesday's quake."There is danger!" they said over the bullhorns. "Leave the buildings!"Chautara, a foothills town, became a hub for rescuers and humanitarian aid after the first earthquake.People salvaged whatever they could from their toppled homes. Most houses appeared to be damaged; some were leveled. Others tilted and rested on adjacent homes."We were in the shop. All of a sudden the building shook. I jumped out of the store and the next second it fell down. It was already tilted by last month's earthquake. I watched it just slide and fall on its side," said Devi Acharya, a convenience store owner.Officials said that army helicopters had been searching through the Sunkhani area, nearly 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Kathmandu, for the missing U.S. helicopter.Tuesday's quake also killed 16 people in northern India and one person in Tibet.The magnitude-7.8 earthquake that hit April 25 killed more than 8,150 people and flattened entire villages, leaving hundreds of thousands homeless in the country's worst quake since 1934.The U.S. Geological Survey said Tuesday's earthquake was the largest aftershock of the April quake. But it was significantly less powerful and occurred deeper in the Earth.The first quake also drove many people to leave damaged homes, which were empty when the new quake caused more damage and collapses.On Wednesday, McGoldrick said the U.N. had revised its donor appeal to call for $423 million. The response to the earlier appeal of $415 million has been low, with about 15 percent of the sum received. 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

6875.txt:- With the safe return of Celia and Rick Wilcox, relief efforts for Nepal with a decidedly strong connection to the Mount Washington Valley were well underway Tuesday.During the 7.8 magnitude earthquake on April 25 that killed approximately 8,000 people and leveled many buildings in the land-locked nation at the top of the world, Wilcoxes, who are mountain guides and co-owners of International Mountain Equipment, were in the midst of leading three clients, accompanied by 10 native guides and porters, on a 22-day trek through the Himalaya Mountains. The trek was originally intended to include a stop at the Mount Everest Base Camp.The side trip to the base camp - where 18 people died in avalanches triggered by the earthquake - was abandoned, but the trekkers nonetheless continued on their preplanned route, reaching Kathmandu without incident. From there, they flew back to the U.S., right on schedule for their May 8 return.On Tuesday, the Wilcoxes were back at the IME offices, fielding calls from concerned friends, colleagues and contractors. In between the calls and drop-in visitors, they devised a plan to help the Nepal community of Khumjung, home to the Sherpa guides they've worked for some 30 years.At the same time, Tsering Sherpa, a Nepal native and resident of North Conway, and Candy Chaplin of Bartlett, president of the Nepal Children's Health and Education Foundation (NCHEF), launched a relief effort of their own.While Sherpa focused on her hometown of Namche Bazaar, where a school and a dentist's office were destroyed in the original earthquake, Chaplin was concentrating on the villages of Bung and Chheskam, where a school was also damaged. In March, Chaplin led 16 students and two parent doctors from the Derryfield School to the towns where they volunteered at a regional health clinic.Celia Wilcox thanked everyone who kept her and Rick in their prayers, noting that 'those prayers were answered ahead of time,' because thanks to careful planning, the IME trekkers were entirely self-reliant, and, when the April 25th earthquake hit, they found themselves in a wide valley that effectively shielded them from both avalanches and rock slides.She corrected early media reports that the IME group lost its possessions when the Hotel Thamel in Kathmandu collapsed - the hotel turned out to be fine - and that the international airport at Kathmandu was shut down because it was damaged and clogged with international aid that wasn't getting to its ultimate destination.Sherpa, whose father, Tsedam, is a close friend of the Wilcoxes and operates a mountaineering store in Nepal, said she and a fellow Fryeburg Academy graduate are hoping to get manufacturers and retailers to donate tents, which would be sent to her homeland.Rick and Celia Wilcox, for their part, are in the early stages of launching a nonprofit to channel monetary donations directly to community leaders in Nepal for rebuilding projects in Khumjung and perhaps Namche Bazaar, too.Tax-deductible donations may be made right now, however, to the NCHEF, where the money would be used to pay for the repair or construction of schools, and for covering the tuition of the three children of a porter who was killed on April 25.Chaplin said she expects to spend a lot of time on the phone to determine what damage was caused by the aftershock.The Wilcoxes added that in addition to supporting one of the several ongoing Nepal relief efforts, the many people who’ve trekked there in recent years should reach out to any local contacts they’ve made and help the country’s recovery by person-to-person assistance.Another way to help, said Celia, would be for people to go on another trek “and leave lots of cash.” jkoziol@newstote.com

6886.txt:Damage reports from the more remote villages are slowly coming in. After an army helicopter surveyed Barpak village, the estimates are that around 1,200 homes were destroyed, and only 4 survived. At least 120 people were evacuated; up to 700 villagers may be dead although that has yet to be confirmed. We don’t yet have specific reports on many of the other villages, but this story is likely to be far too common.
6886.txt:Why Was The Damage So Severe?
6888.txt:Two large buildings damaged in the 7.8-magnitude quake that hit on April 25 collapsed in Kathmandu Tuesday. But Dolakha and Sindhupalchowk, two of the districts worst affected by the original quake, bore the brunt of the damage caused by the fresh tremors.
688.txt:Aid groups readied staff to go to Nepal with supplies to provide clean water, sanitation and emergency food, while the United States, Britain and Pakistan were among countries providing search-and-rescue experts. TRAGEDY IN THE MOUNTAINS An Indian army mountaineering team found 18 bodies on Mount Everest, where an avalanche unleashed by the earthquake swept through base camp. More than 1,000 climbers had gathered there at the start of the climbing season. A tourism official, Mohan Krishna Sapkota, said it was "hard to even assess what the death toll and the extent of damage" around Everest could be. "The trekkers are scattered all around the base camp and some had even trekked further up. It is almost impossible to get in touch with anyone." Around 300,000 foreign tourists were estimated to be in various parts of Nepal for the spring trekking and climbing season in the Himalayas, and officials were overwhelmed by calls from concerned friends and relatives. Romanian climber Alex Gavan tweeted that there had been a "huge earthquake then huge avalanche" at Everest base camp, forcing him to run for his life. In a later tweet he made a desperate appeal for a helicopter to fly in and evacuate climbers who had been hurt: "Many dead. Much more badly injured. More to die if not heli asap."

6922.txt:The Himalayan quake is a multilayered story. It required a range of expertise to capture the various dimensions of the tragedy. This newspaper, in its ‘Science and Technology’ section, covered two important aspects. First, “ >Making buildings earthquake-safe”, which explained how the extent of damage to buildings depended not only on the magnitude of the earthquake, but also on the type of construction practice followed. Second, “ >Himalayas: next major quake may be west of the recent one”, was an early warning piece that looked into the nature of the seismic activity in the region. In the ‘Comment/Perspective’ page, there was an interview with a leading geologist, Michael P. Searle — who, two years ago, predicted a disaster in Nepal — looked at the issues of lack of infrastructure in South Asia along with the other geological details. There were two first person recollections — one by Aditya Adhikari and the other by The Hindu’s Nepal correspondent Damakant Jayshi — which contextualised and gave us the language to understand the tragedy as a human suffering and not as a distant number crunching spectacle.

695.txt:The earthquake was also felt in India’s capital of New Delhi and several other Indian cities. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, called a meeting of top government officials to review the damage and how to respond in parts of India that felt strong tremors. The states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Sikkim, which share a border with Nepal, have reported building damage. Pakistan’s prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, offered “all possible help” that Nepal may need.
6961.txt:Yet many other temples, former monasteries, and various key buildings have been hit. The iconic, 60-metre high, white Dharahara tower built in 1832, one of Kathmandu’s most visible monuments, has been razed to the ground. Kasthamandap, the temple that gave the capital city its name, and Kalomochan temple built in the Mughal style by Jung Bahadur along the Bagmati have been reduced to pieces of wood and rubble. More than 10 neighbourhood temples in Patan have been flattened. In Bungmati, the Rato Mastyendranath temple was destroyed during the festive performance dedicated to the god. The damage caused to the structure of Rana palaces still needs to be assessed but the nineteenth- and twentieth-century parts of Hanuman Dhoka and the Nepal Association of Fine Arts (Nafa) Naxal building now lie in ruins.
6961.txt:Unesco has announced an in-depth expertise of the damage “based thereon to advise and provide support to the Nepalese authorities and local communities on its protection and conservation”. Emphasis should be laid on the restoration techniques to be used, given that the 2015 earthquake has shown the extreme fragility of these monuments. Indeed, this structural weakness is apparent even in day-to-day life. In the 1980s, I myself saw the roofs of Vishwanath temple in Patan Durbar Square fall down all of a sudden during the rainy season, quite independent of any earthquake.

7117.txt:An engineering team from New Zealand has left for Nepal to assess the damage caused by the April 25 earthquake, according to Foreign Minister Murray McCully. The Nepal earthquake on April 25 had killed more than 8000 peole and rendered thousands of citizens homeless. The Foreign minister said on Monday that deployment of engineers followed a request from Nepal. Immediately after the earthquake, New Zealand had offered to send a search and rescue team, which was accepted initially, but declined at the last minute.
7117.txt:Xinhua quoted the Foreign Minister of New Zealand, "the Nepalese government requested assistance from New Zealand experts with damage assessments of critical public infrastructure, including government buildings and hospitals." McCully said four New Zealand engineers, with considerable experience in earthquake strengthening volunteered their time and are en route to Nepal.

7167.txt:Now wooden bookcases lie smashed on the floor of the 120-year-old building, which was gifted to the nation by the Rana dynasty that ruled Nepal for more than a century before losing power in 1951.The library was closed on April 25 when the quake struck, and Karmacharya said it was two days before she plucked up the courage to go and see the destruction."I was speechless for a while... It was hard to believe the extent of the damage," the 58-year-old chief librarian told AFP as she surveyed the impact of the 7.8-magnitude quake, which killed more than 7,800 people."I cried when I got came back home, I couldn't help myself. The books are like my children, and I love them very much."Thank God it was a Saturday and there were no readers inside."Karmacharya estimates that the quake damaged around a third of the 28,000 books in the Kaiser Library.They were the collection of Kaiser Shumsher, a scion of the Rana family who travelled to England in 1908 and fell in love with the grand houses and their private libraries.When he returned to Nepal he decided to build his own in his palace in central Kathmandu.Inside the building, antique statues lie in pieces on the floor and stuffed animal heads and portraits of Nepal's former rulers in full military dress hang precariously on severely cracked walls.In one room are the fragments of a suit of armour smashed to pieces in the quake; in another, a stuffed Bengal tiger and a huge bearskin rug, the head and paws still attached.Books in the English section -- many of which Shumsher brought back from his visit to England -- include John Buchan's adventure classics and such titles as "The Big Game of Asia".But the library is more than an eccentric throwback to a bygone era in Nepal, a feudal Hindu kingdom until just seven years ago when the monarchy was abolished following a Maoist revolution.It also houses rare South Asian manuscripts on Buddhism, Tantrism and astrology, some so old they are written on palm-leaves.

7198.txt:The second earthquake of 7.5 magnitude that struck Nepal on Tuesday has caused massive damage but Chinese Military Helicopters in the region are actively supporting the rescue missions
7199.txt:A city of three million densely packed into haphazard dwellings in a Valley that used to be a former lake was always a recipe for disaster. The earthquakes were no surprise , what was surprising was the relatively low casualty rate.One of the nightmare scenarios for Kathmandu was that transportation and communication would be hit and the capital would be cut off. That did not happen. Roads and the only international airport suffered minimum damage, electricity and phones were restored surprisingly swiftly.However, the most encouraging sign was the sight of Nepal’s young population rushing to deliver emergency aid – filling a gaping gap left by the government. Despite strong aftershocks still shaking the Valley and adjoining districts, young Nepalis were volunteering to collect relief and transporting it to where they were needed the most, sometimes at their own cost. Imagine what the demographic dividend Nepal would reap if we could channel that pent-up energy and commitment to nation-building. At a time when a large swathe of country’s rural population is toiling in foreign lands , the spontaneous self-mobilisation of urban youth eased the pressure on state agencies. The government and the bureaucracy got a lot of flak for being late and disorganised with response.However, the scale of the disaster was such that it would have challenged even well-governed states. Nepal’s security forces deserve a lot of praise for putting their lives on the line to save lives. The country has been fortunate to receive immediate help from governments around the world, which have sent in their disaster relief teams to aid search and rescue operations in the remote districts.But the last three weeks have proven that Nepal needs to strengthen its capacity for disaster preparedness and response. After Tuesday’s 7.3 magnitude aftershock triggered fresh landslides and destruction in Dolakha, Sindhupalchok, Rasuwa we have had to suddenly revert back to search and rescue, while continuing delivery of relief supplies. It is important that both go in tandem as we race against time to provide shelters to millions of people before the rains and ahead of winter.Most families in Kavre and Sindhupalchok have already started building temporary shelters for themselves from local material and salvaged timber and bricks. This is only stopgap and the government must start delivering on a foolproof mechanism for subsidising home rebuilding.Populations in landslide prone areas must be identified, and relocated before the monsoon when slope failure is going to be a constant danger. For the district capitals and Kathmandu Valley the government must finally start strictly enforcing its 25-year-old building code.Large sections of the population in the affected areas outside Kathmandu Valley are subsistence farmers, they need help with seeds for the paddy planting season, otherwise they will go hungry for the rest of the year. In many ways, the monsoon season will seriously test us again.So far, the amount pledged by the donors for reconstruction may be encouraging, but the actual amount received in the PM’s relief fund is disappointing to say the least. Part of the fault is with the PMO which sent conflicting and confusing signals to potential donors already skeptical of the transparency in aid disbursement . The international community also has an opportunity to clean up its act, and not make the same mistakes it was severely criticised for in Haiti.The inflow of aid money is making some political parties salivate, calling for revival of their discredited all-party mechanism at the local level which was a cartel to share the loot. Others are also demanding immediate local elections, while some want a national government.In 2010, when a massive 8.8 magnitude quake hit Chile, only 525 people lost their lives and less than 9 percent of the affected population lost their homes. The same year, a 7.0 magnitude quake in Haiti killed over 100,000 people reducing the capital city to a rubble. Experts credit strict building codes and swift rescue for saving lives in Chile.So, an earthquake doesn’t kill people, lack of preparedness does.
7200.txt:Over 8000 Nepalese people have died, and millions more are believed to be displaced or otherwise affected. In this relatively rural and underdeveloped nation, relief has been inefficient and slow to come. Like the quake that hit Haiti in 2010, the extent of the damage in Nepal is largely due to poverty. Inadequate infrastructure, shoddy buildings and food insecurity has left the country particularly vulnerable to natural disaster, since it is devoid of surplus resources that could act as a safety net. Reports of inadequate food, water, housing and hygiene in makeshift shelters have dominated global coverage of the aftermath of the deadly tremors.
7202.txt:Nepal was left reeling by the April 25 tremor. The impoverished country appealed for billions of pounds in aid from foreign nations, as well as medical experts to treat the wounded and helicopters to ferry food and temporary shelters to hundreds of thousands left homeless amid unseasonal rains. The new quake was deeper, coming from a depth of 11.5 miles, compared with the earlier one at 9.3 miles. Shallow earthquakes tend to cause more damage.

"Currently, Plan teams are spread out across Kathmandu valley and several districts in the affected areas – carrying out their distributions and delivery of emergency items to families who have lost their homes and are in temporary shelter," he said.

7310.txt:- With the safe return of Celia and Rick Wilcox, relief efforts for Nepal with a decidedly strong connection to the Mount Washington Valley were well underway Tuesday.During the 7.8 magnitude earthquake on April 25 that killed approximately 8,000 people and leveled many buildings in the land-locked nation at the top of the world, Wilcoxes, who are mountain guides and co-owners of International Mountain Equipment, were in the midst of leading three clients, accompanied by 10 native guides and porters, on a 22-day trek through the Himalaya Mountains. The trek was originally intended to include a stop at the Mount Everest Base Camp.The side trip to the base camp - where 18 people died in avalanches triggered by the earthquake - was abandoned, but the trekkers nonetheless continued on their preplanned route, reaching Kathmandu without incident. From there, they flew back to the U.S., right on schedule for their May 8 return.On Tuesday, the Wilcoxes were back at the IME offices, fielding calls from concerned friends, colleagues and contractors. In between the calls and drop-in visitors, they devised a plan to help the Nepal community of Khumjung, home to the Sherpa guides they've worked for some 30 years.At the same time, Tsering Sherpa, a Nepal native and resident of North Conway, and Candy Chaplin of Bartlett, president of the Nepal Children's Health and Education Foundation (NCHEF), launched a relief effort of their own.While Sherpa focused on her hometown of Namche Bazaar, where a school and a dentist's office were destroyed in the original earthquake, Chaplin was concentrating on the villages of Bung and Chheskam, where a school was also damaged. In March, Chaplin led 16 students and two parent doctors from the Derryfield School to the towns where they volunteered at a regional health clinic.Celia Wilcox thanked everyone who kept her and Rick in their prayers, noting that 'those prayers were answered ahead of time,' because thanks to careful planning, the IME trekkers were entirely self-reliant, and, when the April 25th earthquake hit, they found themselves in a wide valley that effectively shielded them from both avalanches and rock slides.She corrected early media reports that the IME group lost its possessions when the Hotel Thamel in Kathmandu collapsed - the hotel turned out to be fine - and that the international airport at Kathmandu was shut down because it was damaged and clogged with international aid that wasn't getting to its ultimate destination.Sherpa, whose father, Tsedam, is a close friend of the Wilcoxes and operates a mountaineering store in Nepal, said she and a fellow Fryeburg Academy graduate are hoping to get manufacturers and retailers to donate tents, which would be sent to her homeland.Rick and Celia Wilcox, for their part, are in the early stages of launching a nonprofit to channel monetary donations directly to community leaders in Nepal for rebuilding projects in Khumjung and perhaps Namche Bazaar, too.Tax-deductible donations may be made right now, however, to the NCHEF, where the money would be used to pay for the repair or construction of schools, and for covering the tuition of the three children of a porter who was killed on April 25.Chaplin said she expects to spend a lot of time on the phone to determine what damage was caused by the aftershock.The Wilcoxes added that in addition to supporting one of the several ongoing Nepal relief efforts, the many people who’ve trekked there in recent years should reach out to any local contacts they’ve made and help the country’s recovery by person-to-person assistance.Another way to help, said Celia, would be for people to go on another trek “and leave lots of cash.” jkoziol@newstote.com

745.txt:(MENAFN - The Peninsula) Tens of thousands of people were spending the night in the open under a chilly and thunderous sky after a powerful earthquake devastated Nepal yesterday, killing more than 1,382 people, collapsing modern houses and ancient temples and triggering a landslide on Mount Everest. Officials warned the death toll would rise as more reports came in from far-flung areas.Nepal urged countries to send aid to help it cope with the aftermath as the desperate search for survivors continued into the early hours today.As fears of a humanitarian disaster grew, thousands of people braved freezing temperatures to sleep on pavements, in parks or in fields, too afraid to return to homes damaged by the quake.The US Geological Survey put the magnitude of the quake at 7.9. It said the quake hit at 11:56am local time (0611 GMT) at Lamjung, about 80km northwest of Kathmandu.The quake tore through the middle of highways in the capital and also caused damage to the country's only international airport which was briefly closed. Aftershock tremors could be felt more than two hours after the initial quake.The home ministry said the death toll had reached 1,382. A police spokesman said more than 630 of them were killed in Kathmandu Valley and at least 300 more in the capital."We have launched a massive rescue and rehabilitation action plan and lots needs to be done," said Information and Broadcasting Minister Minendra Rijal. "Our country is in a moment of crisis and we will require tremendous support and aid," he told Indian television.Hospitals across the nation struggled to cope with the dead and injured from Nepal's worst quake in 81 years, and a lack of equipment meant rescuers could look no deeper than surface rubble for signs of life.Areas of Kathmandu were reduced to rubble, and rescue operations had still not begun in some remote areas. Among the capital's landmarks destroyed in the earthquake was the 60-metre-high (100-foot) Dharahara Tower, built in 1832 for the queen of Nepal, with a viewing balcony that had been open to visitors for the last 10 years.A jagged stump 10 metres high was all that was left of the lighthouse-like structure. As bodies were pulled from the ruins, a policeman said up to 200 people had been trapped inside.Across the city, rescuers scrabbled through the rubble of destroyed buildings, among them ancient, wooden Hindu temples.Foreign climbers and their Nepalese guides around Mount Everest were caught by the tremors and a huge avalanche. An Indian army mountaineering team found 18 bodies on Mount Everest, where an avalanche unleashed by the earthquake swept through base camp. More than 1,000 climbers had gathered there at the start of the climbing season.Aid groups readied staff to go to Nepal with supplies to provide clean water, sanitation and emergency food. A spokesman for Nepal's home ministry said the government had released around $500m as emergency funds for rescue operations.Neighbouring India, where 44 people were reported killed in the quake and its aftershocks, was first to respond to calls for help, sending military aircraft with medical equipment and relief teams. Offers of help poured in from governments around the world, with the United States and the European Union announcing they were sending in disaster response teams. There were similar offers from Sri Lanka and Pakistan. In Europe, Britain, Germany, Norway and Spain also pledged support and assistance.China's official Xinhua news agency said that 13 people were killed in the Tibet region.

782.txt:ON BOARD FLIGHT 6E 31: There seemed to be quite a few who had at the last moment cancelled their IndiGo flight to Kathmandu from New Delhi on Sunday . They will be happy they did.The flight, filled with journalists from all over the world and Nepalese citizens going home to meet their families, was on time as it took off at about 20 minutes past 11am. Amrit Sharma, a web entrepreneur settled in Minneapolis, was worried about his mother in Nepal. "I'm happy to be going home," he said in a thick American accent. "Happy and sad."Behind him, two Nepalese men were discussing the extent of damage to their houses. One of them, possibly working in India, said he would have to "remain here for another 10 years."Trouble suddenly started at around 12.45pm when the pilot announced that he had lost contact with the ATC in Kathmandu. Even as the passengers were turning to each other to see if they had understood correctly what he said, there was an explanation a minute later that did nothing to change the mood. "ATC has evacuated the building. We are not able to establish contact."Thousands of feet above ground, in the middle of nowhere, that didn't sound good at all. And that's a deliberate understatement.Ten minutes after that the pilot took the mic again. "Hope you understand. It is beyond our control." Everyone understood. There was no scope for confusion.Another quake had hit Kathmandu, and the 6.9 magnitude tremor had forced everyone in the ATC building to run for their lives. So there was no one to guide the flight from Delhi.But the plane kept going towards Kathmandu, the pilot hopeful that in the next few minutes the ATC men would perhaps come back and take control. That didn't happen. What did, instead, was the message that the runway had now closed. Kathmandu was just 20 minutes away. Another address to the passengers followed. At about 1.15pm, the pilot said that though they don't know the exact intensity of the latest jolt to hit the valley, "we have come to know it was stronger than yesterday". After a silent five minutes, he came back on air, this time to say, "We are not allowed to land. We will have to divert to Delhi."Something resembling a muted yelp came out of Sharma. "My mother," he said.By 1.25pm, the flight was turning back for Delhi. It touched down at the capital at a little past 2pm, but no one was allowed to deplane. "Please remain in your seats," a member of the cabin crew announced. "We are trying to see if it's possible to go back to Kathmandu."At 4.05pm, all passengers were still inside the plane. It had been five hours cooped up in the aircraft and people were getting restless. Half an hour later, the mic crackled to life again. "We have the clearance now, we are going back to Kathmandu."At 10 minutes to 5pm, the 6E 31 took off again. But at 6.15, it was the pilot again. "We are 100 miles short of Kathmandu. The weather is bad and it won't be advisable to penetrate it. Don't worry, we have two hours of fuel."It would take another two hours for the plane to touch down, which it did at 8pm. The one and half hour Delhi-Kathmandu flight had taken close to 9 hours. In the distance from Tribhuvan International Airport was the city of Kathmandu, desolate, bruised and dark.

829.txt:Beyond colossal loss of human lives, if there is anything perhaps equally overwhelming in Nepal's earthquake tragedy, it is the monumental damage the country's iconic heritage has suffered due to the calamity. The powerful temblor practically levelled the nation's tangible cultural history, robbing it of its architectural jewels, including the landmark Dharhara Tower, in an eerie reminder of the 1934 quake that claimed over 10,000 lives. The Kathmandu Valley inscribed in the World Heritage list in 1979 include the Durbar Squares of Hanuman Dhoka (Kathmandu), Patan and Bhaktapur, the Buddhist stupas of Swayambhu and Bauddhanath and the Hindu temples of Pashupati and Changu Narayan. Tragedy came to revisit all the three Squares, as the sites had suffered extensive damage in the 1934 disaster too.

913.txt:KATHMANDU: Racing against time, rescuers on Sunday waded through tonnes of rubble of flattened homes and buildings in Nepal to look for survivors of the earthquake that has killed over 2,350 people, including five Indians, and left more than 6,000 others injured.Fresh powerful aftershocks on Sunday triggered panic among the stricken people and caused avalanches on Mt Everest which had on Saturday taken a toll of 22 lives.A strong 6.7-magnitude aftershock followed by another measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale, sent people scrambling for open spaces.The 7.9-magnitude temblor on Saturday left a trail of devastation and suffering, with people spending the cold night in the open because of fears of fresh quake.According to the latest figures available with the Kathmandu-based National Emergency Operation Centre, the death toll in Nepal stood at 2,352 and 6,239 had been injured.1,053 people are reported killed in the Kathmandu valley alone. Officials fear the death toll could rise as desperate search for survivors continued.International rescue teams, including from India, have touched down here as Nepal declared a state of emergency in the wake of the disaster, the worst in over 80 years of the country's recorded history.India has mounted a major rescue and rehabilitation effort, deploying 13 military aircraft which carried medicines, field hospitals, blankets, 50 tonnes of water and other materials.More than 700 disaster relief experts drawn from the National Disaster Relief Force have been deployed by India.A senior-level inter-ministerial team will visit Nepal to assess how India can better assist in the relief operations.Rescuers have been hunting for survivors under heaps of debris with bare hands as well as heavy equipment though the efforts have been hampered due to fresh tremors, thunderstorms and snowfall in the mountain ranges.Locals and tourists sifted through mounds of debris for survivors. Cheers rose when people were found alive, though mostly bodies were pulled out.MI-17 helicopters of the Indian Air Force (IAF) have carried out five casualty evacuation sorties and the injured have been moved to military hospitals.An Indian attempting to climb all the highest peaks in the seven continents, 54-year-old Ankur Bahl is also stuck at Camp II on Mount Everest along with 11 other fellow climbers.Bahl had moved to Camp II from Camp I on Saturday, but is now stranded due to the earthquake.The earthquake and the aftershocks left behind a trail of death and destruction, flattening houses and buildings, including the iconic Dharhara tower and the landmark Darbar Square in the heart of the capital, trapping scores of people.According to initial reports related to Sunday's aftershock, a tunnel caved in at the Trishuli Hydel Project and around 60 labourers are feared trapped.Hospitals in Nepal are struggling to accommodate the number of injured that is running into thousands. People have been lying scattered on the floor and even on the ground outside and receiving treatment.The Nepalese government has established a fund of Rs 500 million for the reconstruction of the damaged infrastructure.With electric poles and lines uprooted, most parts of the country have no electricity since yesterday afternoon and authorities say the situation is likely to continue for the next few days.26 districts are the most affected in Nepal though the far western part of the country has been declared safe.Offers of help poured in from around the world following the Nepalese government's appeal for assistance, with the US, the European Union as well the United States saying they were sending in disaster response teams.Nepal has requested international assistance in the response to the disaster, with particular importance placed on the search and rescue capacity, medical teams, supplies and tenting for hospitals, heavy equipment for rubble removal and helicopters for transport and access to blocked areas.A large number of Indians, including many workers who visit the neighbouring country, said they were faced with basic problems like food and sanitation.Officials here said five Indians, including the daughter of an Indian embassy employee, were among those killed in the quake.Like many other areas of Nepal, Kathmandu is facing a colossal challenge of dealing with the devastation from the disaster.Whole streets and squares were covered in rubble in the capital, with an estimated metropolitan area population of around 3 million residents.As military helicopters hovered over Kathmandu and ferried relief supplies to victims of the earthquake in western Nepal, search and rescue efforts were going on in at least five locations in Kathmandu.Near Prime Minister Sushil Koirala's official residence, two bulldozers scoured the rubble of a flattened four-storey house. A bystander said it was the local tax office. The bodies of the four staff inside had been recovered minutes before.The United States, Britain, China, Pakistan and European Union countries are among those who have pledged aid.A number of international charities including Red Cross, Oxfam, Doctors Without Borders and Christian Aid are also sending teams to quake-hit areas.The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it was especially worried about the fate of villages near the epicentre of the quake, some 80km from Kathmandu.The problems have been compounded by erratic internet and mobile phone communications.Beyond colossal loss of human lives, if there is anything perhaps equally overwhelming in Nepal's earthquake tragedy, it is the monumental damage the country's iconic heritage has suffered due to the calamity.The powerful temblor practically levelled the nation's tangible cultural history, robbing it of its architectural jewels, including the landmark Dharhara Tower, in an eerie reminder of the 1934 quake that claimed over 10,000 lives.The Kathmandu valley inscribed in the World Heritage list in 1979 include the Durbar Squares of Hanuman Dhoka (Kathmandu), Patan and Bhaktapur, the Buddhist stupas of Swayambhu and Bauddhanath and the Hindu temples of Pashupati and Changu Narayan.Tragedy came to revisit all the three Squares, as the sites had suffered extensive damage in the 1934 disaster too.Nepal is likely to experience widespread rains and thundershowers which may trigger landslides, according to India's weather department which has asked people to remain alert.

947.txt:NEW DELHI: India's rescue and relief operations in Nepal moved into high gear on Sunday with the government sending another 13 military aircraft with rescue personnel and relief material to Kathmandu. After a review meeting of top officials, called by the prime minister, the government decided to send an inter-ministerial team of officials led by an additional secretary to coordinate the massive operation in Nepal. "Rapid rescue and relief is our primary mission at present," foreign secretary S Jaishankar told reporters on Sunday."We are sending a senior level team to Nepal to coordinate everything. This was decided in our meeting with the PM and senior ministers today," he added.Indian armed forces along with National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), being the first foreign teams to reach Nepal, are at the forefront of rescue and relief work, named 'Operation Maitri'.For the Indian Army, which said it was prepared for the long haul in Nepal, there is also an emotional reason beyond the call of duty in a humanitarian crisis. Indian defence has had a 200-year history of Gurkha soldiers from Nepal in the Army. Currently, there are around 40,000 Gurkha soldiers in the Indian Army and around 1.25 lakh retired Gurkha Regiment soldiers in Nepal. Sources said the Indian Army is moved by a sense of "payback".Incidentally, Army chief Gen Dalbir Singh Suhag, who spoke to his Nepalese counterpart Gen SJB Rana soon after the quake to kickstart rescue operations, is an officer of the Gurkha Rifles Regiment. He is also the honorary chief of the Nepalese Army. On Sunday, Gen Suhag cancelled his scheduled trip to Sri Lanka (April 27-30) to monitor rescue operations in Nepal."We are also working along with our Gurkha ex-servicemen interface for guidance, relief and rescue," an Army spokesperson said.Sunday's rescue efforts in Nepal were hampered by powerful aftershocks measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale. With its epicenter in Kodari, the quake forced Kathmandu airport to shut down for a few hours. Despite this, India has mounted a mammoth relief effort, with 13 aircraft, including C-17, IL-76 and AN-32 carrying food, drinking water, blankets and medical supplies, making it into Kathmandu by Sunday evening.Six IAF Mi-17 helicopters flew virtually non-stop since the morning to rescue around 200 people in the Himalayan country. "The helicopters also have Nepalese Army pilots on board to help our pilots familiarize with the terrain. Six persons, for instance, were evacuated by an Mi-17 from the badly-damaged Dhuncha helipad, 50 km north of Kathmandu. Apart from the six Mi-17s already operating in Nepal, six more Indian helicopters are on standby," said an IAF officer.Briefing reporters after the PM's review meeting, top officials - foreign secretary, home secretary, defence secretary and the NDMA chief - said India was currently focused on rescue operations in Kathmandu, before spreading out to other parts of Nepal.Three mobile hospitals have been transported to Nepal, and 10 NDRF teams are at work, officials said.The returning aircraft have been evacuating stranded Indians as well as nationals from other countries. So far, India has brought back almost 1,000 people in military aircraft. In addition, Air India has announced it would run extra flights on reduced fares, while private airlines Jet Airways and Indigo have pitched in with extra planes. More helicopters have been placed on standby, Jaishankar said.IAF aircraft on Sunday also carried 8,000 thousand blankets, 500 tents, 14 tones of food (noodles), 34 paramedics, 100 stretches, 1 tonne of medicine and six tonnes of prepared food.Taking cognizance of the request of the Nepalese government for oxygen on account of problems in the Kathmandu oxygen plant, additional cylinders are being dispatched.Jaishankar said the rescue operation was not without its challenges - phone networks and internet was erratic, which made communication difficult. The phone numbers at the control rooms set up by the Indian government have been overwhelmed by the number of callers, so the government has resorted to social media and emails to register rescue and evacuation requests.The government is currently using Kathmandu airport but will gradually look at using other airports too, Jaishankar said. Questioned about reconstruction, he indicated India would play a big part in that as well.With thousands clamouring to be taken out and crowding the Kathmandu airport, government appealed for patience. Meanwhile, Jaishankar said buses would also be used to remove people from Nepal. The roads were still motorable, but they were clogged with traffic. So the going would be slow, but this would open up another channel of evacuation.Baburam Bhattarai, former Nepal PM, described it as the greatest disaster in 80 years. Expressing appreciation of support and assistance from India and China, he said reports from the more remote areas suggested even greater damage and loss of life, particularly in the mountainous areas.Indian Army Everest Expedition was training at Base Camp when the earthquake struck, said sources. Their equipment was buried in the avalanche, but the team is safe and has helped in recovery of bodies of other foreign climbers. As many as 19 bodies and 61 injured persons were rescued by the Indian Army Expedition Team.
